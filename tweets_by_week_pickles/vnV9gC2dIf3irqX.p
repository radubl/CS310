aS'i am sitting here with laughing because i literally do not know what else to do at this point'
p1550
aS'no its not worth it it will just anger you with the amount of but what about the men going on'
p1551
aS'aaaand godwins law was just brought into play it only took 65 comments on that facebook post'
p1552
aS'men are afraid that women will laugh at them women are afraid that men will kill them'
p1553
aS'oh those angry feminists why would you alienate someone who just wants to help and understand'
p1554
aS'yesallwomen because men feel victimized by our hashtag and insist on using yesallpeople'
p1555
aS'im not sure why im still baffled by some peoples reactions to those violent shootings i should know better by now yesallw\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1556
aS'thats not a straw man get a dictionary because i am not teaching you how to look up the correct use of a word you insist on using'
p1557
aS'i think i need to step away from all of this for a while i am just really really frustrated right now'
p1558
aS'and why are women still running to the defense of men who are whining about their feelings getting hurt when other women speak up'
p1559
aS'im sort of curious as to this rock people seem to live under that they have never heard of nice guy and mras '
p1560
aS'yesallwomen bc women are mocked for being on the wrong side of unrequited like but men are encouraged to pursue until \xe2\x80\xa6'
p1561
aS'because somehow people still use the word feminist as an insult as if asking for equal respect is a disgusting idea \xe2\x80\xa6'
p1562
aS'feeling hella misandrist'
p1563
aS'yesallwomen im not shutting down or censoring myself bc wat im saying is making men feel uncomfortable deal w the dis\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1564
aS'rodgers never views women as people he felt entitled to sex women were how he could get it when he didnt women became the problem'

p1567
aS'it speaks volumes that the yesallwomen tag is still trending this morning'
p1568
aS'because not all men what about the men and feminism is sexist are more common responses than how do we stop thi\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1569
aS'because yesallwomen reminds me that im not alone but that doesnt make me feel any better'
p1570
aS'aaaaand its 3am and i should probably try and sleep'
p1571
aS'yesallwomen because when women try to create a dialogue about their experiences men instantly feel entitled to insert their opinions'
p1572
aS'lt3'
p1573
aS'yesallwomen are taught safety tips to prevent rape but not all men are taught about consent'
p1574
aS'they sell cat shaped key rings that double as weapons because thats the world women live in yesallwomen'
p1575
aS'because when i pointed out that this is what happens when women say no a dude told me so then just say yes yesallw\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1576
aS'because men are using this hashtag to threaten violence amp spew hate they cant stand to have a space where thats not w\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1577
aS'it doesnt matter how old you are the fear of being raped blamed for it and unable to reach justice is always there ye\xe2\x80\xa6'

p1579
aS'there is no fear like the fear you feel for the all women in your life yesallwomen'
p1580
aS'because we have backup plans signals and codes with each other for bars dance floors walking home and large crowds\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1581
aS'because women who espouse feminist ideals and views are still afraid to call themselves feminists yesallwomen'
p1582
aS'because far too many women feel the need to apologize for their opinions yesallwomen'
p1583
aS'we are forced to develop techniques for avoiding social interactions in public places because our no is constantly ignored yesallwomen'
p1584
aS'because were prudes when we dont sleep with you and whores when we do yesallwomen'
p1585
aS'yesallwomen were told to yell fire instead of rape because people would be more likely to respond'
p1586
aS'yesallwomen either know another woman who has been raped or have been sexually assaulted themselves'
p1587
aS'women died because of the misogyny and hatred of women in this country and youre more concerned about your own hurt feelings fuck off'

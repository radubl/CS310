S'the pok\xc3\xa9ball only shook once its almost as if it wanted to be caught p'
p3
aS'i mean the spritzee was just there and i was like didnt s want one o so then i caught it and stuff u'
p4
aS'well if it really is easy then ok p'
p5
aS'you know the pistol shrimps p'
p6
aS'do you have a clauncherclawitzer one of those would be nice if its convenient'
p7
aS'didnt you say you wanted a spritzee i just caught one'
p8
aS'ah yes im all too familiar with it p'
p9
aS'\xc3\x9f'
p10
aS'\xc3\x9f'
p11
aS'your starter hadnt even reached its final form xd'
p12
aS'floats around for no reason'
p13
aS'yeah you can always rely on tons of postgame stuff to do in pok\xc3\xa9mon p'
p14
aS'oh dear got to head to bed gtgt goo nite o'
p15
aS'every now and then peace and quiet is nice p'
p16
aS'well cool then o i am a firm believer in the more the merrier p'
p17
aS'theres always like three conversations going at once or two conversations and a large game it tends to get loud p'
p18
aS'also a love of talking xd you should see our family reunions xd'
p19
aS'i dont think i exaggerated anything too much i tend to exaggerate to make a point bombast runs in the family xd'
p20
aS'heh that got a little rantish back there  i didnt think the conversation would evolve so drastically xd'
p21
aS'come to think of it the term mamas boy comes close o but its not quite the same'
p22
aS'i like girls better in every way 3 p'
p23
aS'id probably fall under that category myself  i tend to feel more comfortable around girls than guys'
p24
aS'there is a definitive lack of a tomboy equivalent for guys that is in term and culture there is such thing'
p25
aS'infact two of my friends and my sister could be described as tomboystomboyish p theres nothing wrong with being a tomboy'
p26
aS'well generalizations some women are naturally more masculine'
p27
aS'nyes it is indeed a theory i think i forgot to mention that p'
p28
aS'if either gender should be more like the other its men who should be more like women not the other way around'
p29
aS'in other words feminism is good but not when it sacrifices femininity'
p30
aS'thats why movies never stopped playing during the depression a healthy amount of escapism'
p31
aS'i think thats the appeal i think thats why genderswaps are so popular too'
p32
aS'humanization lets you slightly reimagine and redesign the character while adding youre own flare to it'
p33
aS'well thats one reason anyway'
p34
aS'as a backlash due to all the overdone hyperfeminism thats so prevalent in recent times'
p35
aS'while thats true i think the bronies are actually seeking a more traditional view on femininity which is all but gone'
p36
aS'yurp i had a feeling youd jump in and say it when i didnt p'
p37
aS'oh i definitely agree with you there id much rather sit through mlpfim than law amp order xd'
p38
aS'but sadly now all the tough guy likes cutsey wutsey stuff jokes i feel have lost some of their power p xd'
p39
aS'once i figured it out it actually makes sense  strangely enough'
p40
aS'like the regular show i see a lot of humanized mordecais and rigbies p'
p41
aS'i saw a lot of humanizations before human versions were even announced fans already do that a lot with animal cartoons'
p42
aS'well monkey that o'
p43
aS'yeah my point was more if you dont already like cartoons dont bother xd there are different types of cartoons after all'
p44
aS'i was actually quite fascinated by the whole thing for a while i think i figured it all out xd that is why they like it'
p45
aS'of course p i think they saw fan art and were like hey this might just be marketable o xd'
p46
aS'xd'
p47
aS'i like the idea of it but i think they should just skip the 3rd and work on the next generation morelonger'
p48
aS'thats the way i see it anyway p'
p49
aS'if youre already really into cartoons you should try it but if cartoons arent your thing you probably wont like it'
p50
aS'but when all is said and done its still a kids show with kids show production values'
p51
aS'im not a huge fan myself i get it i get why otherwise normal guys like it'
p52
aS'its hard to believe they actually did that i mean fans doing it left and right is one thing but making it official'
p53
aS'goodness potatoes  girl how you do that o did you just speed run through the entire game xd'
p54
aS'haha xd it exists '
p55
aS'hmm now i want to see the all the main characters as hamsters o'
p56
aS'youre probably too sane or something xp'
p57
aS'i expected another platinum p in other words the same game with random junk thrown in xd'
p58
aS'and yoshi u'
p59
aS'that makes me picture hamsters flying through the air in a frenzy of chaos xd'
p60
aS'friendship is hamsters i like the sound of that xd'
p61
aS'i ended up skipping white 2 o'
p62
aS'we never even got smg2 xd even though we were planning on it p'
p63
aS'so apparently shes fine which is nice to know p'
p64
aS'weve always had cats had had five for a while but then one ran away shes been seen since then and she was still fat xd'
p65
aS'and friendship gtgt hamsters are also friendship xp'
p66
aS'they should do the same with morgan freeman u so many people would watch that xd'
p67

p68
aS'they are inherently cutefunny p'
p69
aS'dude u xd'
p70
aS'not that i know what youre talking about but i stand by what i said sean connery every character u'
p71
aS'i think they should cast sean connery as every character u itll be better that way'
p72
aS'i dont usually have that problem but it just so happens im in the middle of playing like four games right now p'
p73
aS'i will be joining in the indefinite future p'
p74
aS'i face a similar dilemma im trying to catch up with a friend whos ahead of me but im more experienced itll work outp'

p287
aS'well in the moment i was looking forward to you commenting on the finished product '
p288
aS'which is why im always kicking myself for falling behind but i cant even put sufficient time and effort into my own work'
p289
aS'heh yeah i know that feel bro  i have more friends that dont comment than ones that do i know how important it is'
p290
aS'to gain the praise and respect'

aS'each draw a picture and then show each other'
p300
aS'that exchange of art and ideas between fellow artists is something that ive always craved ever since my brothers and i would'
p301
aS'i think this supports my thoughts that art or at least cartoons and such are meant to be shared with friends'
p302
aS'connect with the fans on a more personal level because there were too many'
p303
aS'thinking about this made me remember certain youtubers complaining about how after they became famous they couldnt'
p304
aS'i was looking forward to sharing them'
p305
aS'but i must say i found myself wondering what youd say about my drawings as i was drawing them in a good way of course'
p306
aS'having only one person consistently commenting can be a downer'
p307
aS'and of course i know that feeling while i should be glad that i have any friends that can keep up with my art and i am'
p308
aS'while arts meant to be shared imo i think its meant to be shared with those that care about yourandom passersby mean little'
p309
aS'but id say its meant to be shared like pretty much everything thats why it bothers me when i fall behind on friends art'
p310
aS'and i suppose certain types of art could be a form of prayer or meditation just between you and god'
p311
aS'unappreciated its kind of a waste on the other hand it can be helpful to the artist just to make it'
p312
aS'finish a drawing they want to show it to people its only natural to want to share art if art is left unseen and'
p313
aS'if thats true then ive been wasting the past ten years of my life but seriously whats the first thing kids do when they'

p456
aS'i am eating a chilidog u'
p457
aS'but im not inpractice with my witty comebacks either p'
p458
aS'thats not to say im incapable of coming up with witty rebuttals i just choose not to i prefer to defuse amp naturalize arguments'
p459
aS'of course most of said insults arent actually a bad thing but said person insulting me would see them as such'
p460
aS'p more like no one is better at insulting me than me'

aS'ok i think about other cartoon animals too but saying ponies is more funny b'
p466
aS'the origins and meaning of the universe and reality its self thats the sort of thing i think about and ponies b'
p467
aS'no matter how much or how little we know about the universe someone can always say well god caused it because god is inescapable'
p468
aS'either way you are dealing with the infinite which is beyond human understanding'
p469
aS'and the idea that the universe cyclicaluniverse or multiverse always existed makes no more rational sense than a god who always existed'
p470
aS'the idea that something was created by nothing is completely unscientific'
p471
aS'in short sometimes i feel the same waysimilarly  in fact quite often'
p472
aS'i dont really want to go on but i still totally want to maintain my friendships'
p473
aS'i sometimes feel anxious when going on twitter amp da'
p474
aS'id like to add that just because i dislike the method of communication doesnt mean i dislike th people im talking to'
p475
aS'well yes but when its directed at and about someone else thats different thats what i meant'
p476
aS'yeah'
p477
aS'its disturbing just thinking about it'
p478
aS'im just glad no one was hurt  but god help the shooter i cant imagine how messed up someone has to be to do that'
p479
aS'amen to that i was a little worried for a while it being in your state'
p480
aS'indeediblydubitably o'
p481
aS'im playing pok\xc3\xa9mon y and i was catching a bunch of skrelp to get one with the right nature i ended up getting a shiny first '
p482
aS'but by how much is it worth the risk of making things worse stuff like that has a tendency to backfire'
p483
aS'well hopefully its temporary and she just needs a little time before talking about it i dont really know though'
p484
aS'oh hmm in that case i got nothing '
p485
aS'im a man who would wash the stupid soap dish especially when its so conveniently near the sink b'
p486
aS'there could easily be something more to it though it may be a combination of things'
p487
aS'my guess would be that it was you saying it got worse after she tried to cheer you up that could make someone feel unappreciated'
p488
aS'yeah i dont think that was it it was probably something else you said around the same time not that i claim to understand it'
p489
aS'i say quite right old bean u i am indeed a dapper squid fank yoo wappeh u d'

ag119
aS'but correcting someone can totally backfire thats why we need to be understanding and diplomatic'
p524
aS'the way i see it everyone is wrong about something only god can know everything and be right about everything'
p525
aS'we all need to try to see things from others point of view even if only to better correct them'
p526
aS'i meant that they can be as biased as it gets but yes everyone is at least a little biased'
p527
aS'i wasnt prepared for a doubledose of negative'

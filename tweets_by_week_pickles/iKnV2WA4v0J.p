p22
aS'how ironic that this pork barrel system was snuffed out of existence by marcos and brought to life in 1986 by cory aquino'
p23
aS'yeah and your professor probably did not have a clue what he or she was talking about'
p24
aS'settle down people most of you dont even know what pork barrel is it is an appropriation that differs from an earmark big differnce'
p25
aS'wtf a five year old can write better english than that oh my bad that was not english that was jibberish'
p26
aS'that is always the problem when it comes to having a liberally leaning government spending is always augmented and infused'
p27
aS'the biggest problem is you people keep electing representatives who are total dumb asses'
p28
aS'it seems that most of you dont know how to engage in critical thinking you cant just agree or disagree on issues'
p29
aS'it is not confusing it should not have been a pressing issue if the legislative body did not have too much power in disbursements'
p30
aS'in plain english dap is like a reserve accounts when the checking account can not cover you dip into that account to transfer funds'
p31
aS'the biggest casualty is the constitution are you freakin serious how about the taxpayers did that ever cross your mind'
p32
aS'what are you talking about pdaf is just the proper nomenclature for pork barrel they are the same anybody home'
p33
aS'how do you foolproof a law please pick my brains and enlighten me academically'
p34
aS'the problem in philippine politics is that too much power is inherently afforded to lawmakers where they can dig deep into endless funds'
p35
aS'i dont know what the fuss is all about it is not like these kinds of corruptions and anomalies have never happened before'
p36

aS'pdaf should only be dedicated to hard projects like local infrastructure projects and terminate funding on ngos it does not make any sense'
p46
aS'what is the funding for each senator now on pdaf back in 2006 it was 200 million it is bank with no vault'
p47
aS'so get rid of that appropriation in other words all funding should be approved by the executive government'
p48
aS'to all the media morons appropriation is not the problem here it is the process of disbursing funds checks and balance'
p49
aS'snow is coming cant wait for the insanely huge dump anyone heading to boreal within the next two weeks tmcc'
p50
aS'cant wait for the huge dump snow falling that is anyone heading to boreal within the next two weeks'
p51
aS'so in many ways all funding approved by the central govt works better you know just like in china where everything is handled by the ccp'
p52
aS'i dont see the connection between the two it looks like you are an infinite moron'
p53
aS'the bottom line is the lack of checks and balances there should be an executive commission that monitors the disbursement of lawmakers'
p54
aS'it sounds confusing but in reality pdaf is the proper name for the nomenclature of pork barrel'
p55
aS'there is nothing wrong with that kind of appropriation the unchecked discretionary funding of lawmakers is the problem'
p56
aS'rethink what role of congress so the disbursement of local funding should come directly from the executive branch correct'

aS'the problem is not the pork barrel appropriation it is the virtually unmonitored discretionary funding of pdaf philippines'
p58
aS'that means you are a lousy cook'
p59
aS'does anyone who go to tmcc want to go skiing this season'

aS'the problem is not the pork barrel mainly it is the budgetary process where lawmakers have unfettered discretion on disbursement a'
p63
aS'you can scrap that without that funding local government projects would not exist'
p64
aS'are you a pow you are so damn skinny you look like you just walked out of a concentration camp'
p65

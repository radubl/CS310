p124
aS'cherish the moments you have of freedom for the world is cold and cruel'
p125
aS'i know all of you disagree on the subject but its a damn twitter debate this isnt worth fighting over'
p126
aS'youre all grown up enough to have opinions amp id hope mature enough to discuss them civily'
p127
aS'all of you stop this isnt how you civily discuss things he said this they attacked me stop'
p128
aS'if you saw my feed youll understand ironically i got brought into the subject to mediate so i failed in my mission'
p129
aS'since when did i go from defensive arguing against people to mediating situations to peaceful compromise'
p130
aS'i was talking about the term calling out phrases like that inflame the situation regardless of the subject'
p131
aS'he wasnt doing that entirely the initial tweet was a question not an outright attack'
p132
aS'the rhetoric and tone of the statements you made was inflamatory but so were the others calling out doesnt help'
p133
aS'and chad has his place in that but you insulted him publicly as well so dont be pious'
p134
aS'true but no need to make inflamatory statements on the matter make this a discussion not an argument'
p135
aS'now thats unfair he has the right to say it at any time he wants regardless of if its disrespectful'
p136
aS'theres nothing wrong with having this discussion but the lack of civility between all of you is a problem'
p137
aS'for you thats fine but theres a socially accepted time of mourning for public figures amp that was violated'
p138
aS'that is not what is being debated here the way you said it was bashing her during the accepted time of mourning'
p139
aS'because joan like pryor amp carlin paved the way for chad to openly make these jokes without persecution'
p140
aS'now to be fair rivers wouldve agreed with chads mentality as well but theres something about that'
p141
aS'you didnt make a joke you made a statement about her literally less than an hour after her death'
p142
aS'this disconnect is what caused the anger to flare not the actual content of the conversation'
p143
aS'carlos amp pat see the debate as something to be discussed after a mourning period amp not before'
p144
aS'theres a disconnect here between the seeable problems chad sees her behavior as the debate'
p145
aS'carlos amp pat got too heated in their responses amp went overboard but so have a lot of people'
p146
aS'while your viewpoints and opinions were valid amp citable they argued that it was too soon'
p147
aS'chad theres a degree of respect given to the dead for a period of time'
p148
aS'just a tad but so did carlos amp chad you all have a right to your opinions but be fair to all parties involved'
p149
aS'yeah exactly plenty of very important historical figures were total assholes but still left the world with a po\xe2\x80\xa6'
p150
aS'the real winner in all of this is for being opinionated but very civil amp fair im glad theres still people like her'
p151
aS'im just gonna step back from all this hate'
p152
aS'i really have never heard of that'
p153
aS'she was a huge proponent of equal rights for women and lgbt back in the damn 60s she helped propell the feminist movement'
p154
aS'if this is about joan rivers dont make this a political debate she died today amp theres a period where thats respected'
p155
aS'why does that even matter beyonce isnt related to this who cares'
p156
aS'damn joan rivers was hilarious she was making my mom laugh in college rest in peace you hilarious woman'
p157
aS'dwarf planet'

p298
aS'its not me associating that with negative terminology for lgbt its me using the actual definition of the word'
p299
aS'i just dont like being seen as a bigot when i use it in a different context when i describe something as queer its odd'
p300
aS'though that was far darker and more gruesome in its history'
p301
aS'originally it was used as a slur since they were odd much the same way that fag came to have its meaning'

p306
aS'while i understand that reclaimed slurs are not legitimate by any means gay was originally a slur but its fine now'
p307
aS'and if youd like to say otherwise explain to me why homosexuals still use the phrase were here were queer so get used to it'
p308
aS'from what ive seen of actual politicalsocial discourse amp discussion queer is not used as a slur but as an acceptable term for gay men'

p469
aS'thats certainly something to climax over'
p470
aS'which causes you to perceive whatever youre thinking about to be alien amp foreign youre brain doesnt recognize it properly'
p471
aS'its because your brain keeps firing off stimuli to the neurons associated with that word eventually making them tired'

aS'nah'
p473
aS'because tumblr is a fickle thing amp likes to seem edgy enough to seem attractive to hipsters but not too much to offend artists'

p685
aS'im debating doing a stream but i have too much work to do around the house so im not sure if thats a good idea'
p686
aS'i force myself to wake up at 1030 despite the fact ill need to be up way earlier for classes this semester'
p687
aS'if quinns smart shell go on rounds of press interviews amp that will put this to rest when shes done'
p688
aS'again with a proper public statement or press conferenceinterview it will be put to rest'
p689
aS'which will be sooner when the press stops feeding it look up the agenda setting theory of media amp youll see what i mean'
p690
aS'no but those people only have power because theres still fire but like any fire this will burn itself out'
p691
aS'luck you'
p692
aS'when the press stops caring the world stops caring because media amp the press control what people believe'
p693
aS'no but if its done right the action will stop the press from covering it which is what really matters not the forums'
p694
aS'they have one of these at my uni for anyone to use its awesome'
p695
aS'you strike it at the source with a wellwritten and final statement on the matter or with a press conference'
p696
aS'will she actually do that probably not but someone will probably do that for her at some point'
p697
aS'and this is the living definition of damage control'
p698
aS'theres a difference between getting a consultant for damage control vs having an entire department'
p699
aS'shoutout to mike hes great'
p700
aS'thanks bae lt3'
p701
aS'if she talks to a pr person shell quiet down really quickly amp just stick to working on games'
p702
aS'which isnt the best thing for fish to do but quinn would be best off laying low for a few months'
p703
aS'true but she may need to duck out of the scene for awhile like fish did'
p704
aS'well i didnt realize i didnt plug in my laptop so it nearly died on me'
p705
aS'noice'
p706
aS'i like having intelligent discussions like this its incredibly refreshing amp its nice having civil parties'
p707
aS'more that this is more of an ideologybased argument rather than a industrybased one like fishs'
p708
aS'the anger and hatred of both sides against each other on the internet is what makes this so much worse than it needs to be'
p709
aS'the irony is that it happens all across journalism platforms but it never gets out the vitriol is what sets this apart'
p710
aS'if anything its mainly a blow to grayson amp kotaku but its very likely that this will be a setback for all of us'
p711
aS'youre completely right about this only being indicative of quinn amp grayson but that view will not hold up for everyone'
p712
aS'to people like us thats true but from the outside looking in thats where the public opinion changes'
p713
aS'yeah but fish is an apple to this orange'
p714
aS'feel better'
p715
aS'on top of that its been admitted by grayson of there being a relationship amp him not disclosing it fully'
p716
aS'very true but theres no way that this will just slide off kotakus record so easily it will leave scars'
p717
aS'ive seen bigger mainstream reporters go down for things like this amp considering the vitriol here grayson may be no different'
p718
aS'as is the way of arguments on the internet fire always starts and then it engulfs everything'
p719
aS'that may not be entirely true but thats how the outside public will see it if nothing else kotakus gonna take a mahor hit'
p720
aS'kotaku is one of the largest gaming journalism orgs amp if they can have a breach of conduct like this anyone can'
p721
aS'i disagree that journalism isnt affected by this its a terrible blow to how the public sees gaming journalism'
p722
aS'her response shouldve been swift and concise rather than vague and heavyhanded'
p723
aS'i dont think the internets the problem more than the lack of professionalism on her part amp the way she responded to this'
p724
aS'could you get me a link for the statement i cant find it'
p725
aS'i didnt see a statement from kotaku so ill have to go check that out'
p726
aS'there may be more games but theyll get way harsher criticism amp may never be successful not matter the quality'
p727
aS'however i will make it clear most of the evidence in this is conjecture amp i think we should all be open to the idea it could be false'
p728
aS'graysons lost all credibility amp if kotaku has any brains will either prove these accusations false or cut him loose'
p729
aS'exactly i feel that quinns dug herself into a hole shell never get out of probably will never release another game'
p730
aS'im much the same way i feel blame needs to be placed on all sides amp not on ideologies amp hypocrisy cuz its everywhere here'
p731
aS'and that really puts off people from having intelligent discussions like this no vitriol no hate just discussion'
p732
aS'but if she completely contradicts herself she has no place in being a paragon for feminism which makes her a liar'
p733
aS'exactly the hypocrisy that she puts out there the problem with this debate about feminism is the hate coming from both sides'
p734
aS'completely and it ruins a discussion about professionalism that needs to be addressed not hate about feminism'
p735
aS'which definitely proves the fact there is an antifeminism movement filled with virtiol but its unevenly placing blame'
p736
aS'completely out of line amp worse than the situation that spurred the backlash its fucked up'
p737
aS'shes definitely at fault but you cany levy everything about the situation on 1 party you need 2 people to have sex at least'
p738
aS'i feel that grayson isnt getting nearly as much backlash as he deserves amp quinns getting all of it unfairly'
p739
aS'thats entirely probable amp it toxifies the discussion but quinns heavyhanded reaction also causes problems'
p740
aS'thats why i stopped at 2 tweets putting blame on both each has blame for their reasons amp lack of professionalism'
p741
aS'however i feel that when this was made into a feminist argument thats when people got too harsh amp the vitriol went too high'
p742
aS'i saw amp i completely agree with that grayson needs retribution for his actions which give a bad name to game journalists'
p743
aS'well theres 2 reasons quinns hypocrisy on feminism and graysons incredible unprofessionalism as a journalist'
p744
aS'i agree however we can only work with the evidence we have now he called out specific people which means there was intent'
p745
aS'graysons actions as a journalist are disgraceful amp i dont think thats getting played up nearly as much'
p746
aS'quinn went against her morals to get ahead in a field amp proved herself a complete hypocrite amp liar to her fans'
p747
aS'i agree that it shouldnt have gone as far as it has but backlash is definitely warranted for both parties'
p748
aS'the unprofessionalism of grayson amp quinn is horrid they bring shame to each of their names amp respective fields'
p749
aS'as someone whos studied the press amp journalism my entire life the whole zoe quinn situation is absolutely disgusting'
p750
aS'thats standard fare for a quality lets play long enough to show progress short enough to keep their attention'
p751
aS'i completely agree'
p752
aS'im off to bed because its almost 230 and i need a better sleep pattern than what i have now'

p2357
aS'i was worried about that sorry man didnt mean to keep you involved'
p2358
aS'yes amp no attitude affects actions amp thus treatment one cannot exist without the other its rigged against you'
p2359
aS'when they walk city streets they have to worry about everything men have to worry about but they also had to worry about rape'
p2360
aS'and thats a sad truth for you i had a conversation yesterday with friends in boston that i felt bad for women because'
p2361
aS'in the end you have to take statistics with a grain of salt unless they have parameters closer to yours'

aS'you are far more fortunate in where you were born than where my cousin was born for incidencents of rape amp abuse'

aS'for battered women which includes spousal rape amp abuse on the other hand south carolina has the worst'

aS'with the opinions of 25year olds the 65year olds dont affect you as much as those in your age bracket'
p2366
aS'yes but that isnt the concensus of your age group the thing with statistics is youre putting 65year olds'
p2367
aS'i have experience with that firsthand its terrible to see that happen to someone'
p2368
aS'while that is true rape culture is far more overplayed than what the internet amp the media will have you believe'
p2369
aS'and while its true that the worst happens to the victim in the case of rape all actions we do affect others'
p2370
aS'burying your daughtersisterwife is a lot worse than having to get them mental treatment'

aS'i wouldnt say that no sensible nation wants nuclear war but ground war is always possible'
p2420
aS'should we start hoarding bottlecaps amp supplies probably not but we definitely should be aware of the political situation in europe'
p2421
aS'the best case scenario besides complete diplomatic peace amp good relations is another cold war the worstwell itll be a real fallout'
p2422
aS'however our defense spending and military power could handle russia for awhile but nuclear war would end it very quickly'
p2423
aS'and of course russias the second largest nuclear arms power besides us their military resources could be incredibly formidable'
p2424
aS'on top of that chinas a very good friend to russia in the un as well as trade wise together they could cause chaos easily'
p2425
aS'russia can sustain itself during a war they have enough internal resources to survivng embargos amp severing assests on their own'
p2426
aS'putin was really high in the kgb amp kremlin during the soviet union so him getting ready for war against the west is plausible'
p2427
aS'russias never seemed to have gotten over the anger towards the us since the soviet union amp putins been really bloodthirsty recently'

p2519
aS'seriously i was researching for an assignment ill barely have time to do tomorrow and instead of that i watch a documentary on politicians'
p2520
aS'i made solid progress in my homework however the roosevelts was far too fascinating for me to ignore dear lord im such a nerd'

p2529
aS'milly pls'
p2530
aS'surprise i finally have content for you guys on the channel this time its the stanley parable pt 4 i win'
p2531
aS'id rather not have either of us get angry because theres no reason for it good discussion nonetheless'
p2532
aS'however my focus on what matter in the scandal originally was different from yours neither of us are wrong just not the same'
p2533
aS'we could discuss this all day but were really just arguing little things we both believe quinn was mistreated'
p2534
aS'obviously the police thing is shaky but its better than shouting on the internet'
p2535
aS'thats terribly incorrect a lot of male journalists were demonized on various blogs amp sites for gamergate articles'
p2536
aS'however having shouting matches between angry sides doesnt do a damn thing for public debate if anything it hurts feminism'
p2537
aS'or for that matter being a white male gamer in the first place the same goes for women'
p2538
aS'there is no reason why any male gamerjournalist needs to be pinned as a sexist for reporting on feminist cases objectively'
p2539
aS'the behavior on both sides of this was atrocious it demonized way too many innocent populations amp made mountains from nothing'
p2540
aS'im not saying quinns at fault here not entirely her pr approach was bad but it doesnt excuse the behavior that caused it'
p2541
aS'theres no point in making something private into public for your own gain both sides did it amp both are wrong for it'
p2542
aS'i mean authorities can be contacted and even if she didnt publicize them the internet wouldve on its own'
p2543
aS'by noticing amp publicizing to which i meant making it public you cant not notice but you can keep it quiet'
p2544
aS'obviously but the pr approaches for both couldve been handled the same way pr strategies can be used widely'
p2545
aS'its called a jeffersonian approach when he was asked about a scandal he ignored it amp eventually it died same tactic here'
p2546
aS'she was being barraged by multiple people made a tweet simply saying to report them amp when it got bad left the public eye'
p2547
aS'i didnt say to not notice it just dont make a big deal about it zelda williams handled her situation better than quinn'
p2548
aS'she followed in the style of phil fishs offense and weve seen how much hes lost because of it'
p2549
aS'she just needed to refute the charges and contact authorities if any threats were made thats properly handling it'
p2550
aS'by noticing and publicizing everything that happened it rallied both sides amp now its never going to end not for awhile'
p2551
aS'pathoswise no but pr wise she wasnt doing what she couldve in her best interests she didnt handle it properly'
p2552
aS'no he did publish them but the problem was if he was biased due to a relationship it was an ethics issue at its core'
p2553
aS'quinns heavyhanded tactics of dealing with the crisis caused her more harm than the allegations did it inflamed everything'
p2554
aS'however the reason why this is still going is over incredibly petty reasoning amp immaturity on both sides'
p2555
aS'however to say that its uncommon is a lie most journalists are friends with their sources sometimes more'
p2556
aS'kotakus ceo did say grayson amp quinn had some form of a relationship not determined sexual which is still not right'
p2557
aS'well it appears that i was wrong there was a change in the story since the last i checked on it there was no timeline'
p2558
aS'ill try to find them but grayson last ive read never gave a public statement on the matter his boss did backing him'
p2559
aS'now grayson the journalist said that the initial review of her game was unbiased amp that their relationship wasnt going on'
p2560
aS'dates given correspond with his review of her gamestudio and an overviewpraise of her amp what shes done'
p2561
aS'obviously amp anyone that thinks so is foolish cracked never wants to be seen as a journalism site'
p2562
aS'you can make anything youd like about that but the original amp only pertinent story about zoe quinn is the relationship'
p2563
aS'the fact that a gaming journalist from one of the most wellknown gaming sites had a relationship with someone he wrote about'
p2564
aS'i mean its not really a journalism site its never claimed to be its meant for humor at its core amp thats what it does'
p2565
aS'i look at that case amp dont see the reason it had to become a feminist argument its irrelevant to the real story'
p2566
aS'well i actually decided to go legal for a change and this is what i get'
p2567
aS'when you see when youre full of passion its much better its all metaphorical'
p2568
aS'youre hungry you want to get your next meal amp hes a prime piece of meat look at him through that lens'
p2569
aS'now play with your hair and look at him like a lioness looks at prey'
p2570
aS'yes'
p2571
aS'microsoft like any conglomerate loves to buy businesses they can expand to make money from mojang can do that'
p2572
aS'that fact is killing me'
p2573
aS'practice makes perfect love'
p2574
aS'have fun with it'
p2575
aS'nah'
p2576
aS'oh it totally is its helping your dark side which is way more fun'
p2577
aS'hey baby'
p2578
aS'thanks i appreciate it'
p2579
aS'twitter at least makes dissent opinions more viable amp less ignored than tumblr'
p2580
aS'id say that its the opposite on topics like feminism the internet controls the discussion'
p2581
aS'i have 150 on there from all the gift cards my sister amp i have been given as gifts'
p2582
aS'its an androop thank you very much'
p2583
aS'im thankful im having this discussion before everyones up and on twitter'
p2584
aS'how do you do that'
p2585
aS'theres no ability to dissent because the entire site is full of hiveminded brainwashed drones that dont think for themselves'
p2586
aS'm4a which dont seem to move to my phone properly'
p2587
aS'and in order to even comment on an opinion you have to put your opinion openly on your blog amp appear to endorse it to some people'
p2588
aS'ive had teachers like that fun class periods but you dont learn much'
p2589
aS'keep him on track then'
p2590
aS'google makes an app to bring itunes media files over amp i cant bring over an album i paid for legally on my phone bullshit'
p2591
aS'fuck you itunes not going over to the google play like youre supposed to this is why people torrent music because your codec sucks'
p2592
aS'the social justice people are so egocentric amp brainwashed by the hive mind that they treat everyone as lesser'
p2593
aS'i go on tumblr for less than 5 minutes this morning amp i already remembered why i hate the site too much opinionated groupthink'
p2594
aS'i was up at 7 to leave for 8 for an hour commute to reach a 930 class i hate being a commuter tuesdays amp thursdays'
p2595

p2836
aS'clicking the favorite button isnt'
p2837
aS'i see'
p2838
aS'obviously thats why being an entertainer is so difficult'
p2839
aS'im lucky to get any positive feedback from my humor on the internet everyones so jaded'
p2840
aS'im somehow wittier on the internet and you all ignore me yet all of my friends irl think im brilliant recognize my brilliance'
p2841
aS'i really respect the fact theyre that comfortable with their bodies amp they do it artistically you could totally do it'
p2842
aS'the one from the girl you retweeted geek goddesses i think it was'
p2843
aS'i would believe that is the case according to the old rules of the internet'
p2844
aS'like i navigated away because while the cosplayers are hot i dont really look at cosplay to see hot women'
p2845
aS'so in a matter of 10 minutes as i leisurely stroll through cosplay i find myself on a site of naked cosplayers welcome to the internet'
p2846
aS'i finished my presentation bought the ssd ive been wanting for my laptop a 2nd monitor amp hdmi cable and its not even 10'
p2847
aS'quite literally so you could probably see your reflection'
p2848
aS'well im out of it for the mostpart beyond studying it for my research paper so theres definitely a sense of relief'
p2849
aS'i cannot stand iambic pentameter'
p2850
aS'i dont want to have any piece of work that i do bring me into gamergate let alone be championed by 4chan and the like'
p2851
aS'and its better that i dont because then my point of it being purely journalistic will be turned into sexism id hate that'
p2852
aS'yeah my professor advised me about it today lets me free up my mind a bit honestly more time to worry about less'
p2853
aS'yeah thats the main reason i could point to for it not being released any local information gets locked up'
p2854
aS'so theres no reason risking a libel lawsuit for something so silly i will only lose from putting it out there'
p2855
aS'theres more proof on the journalist than the student i dont need to prove anything to the public she does'
p2856
aS'now if i were a really cynical person the response could be seen as them trying to make me go quiet but its not worth it'
p2857
aS'it becomes a federal investigation putting a lot more restrictions on who can see and post details on the case'
p2858
aS'federal investigations go under different laws of security compared with states amp localities'
p2859
aS'i did however the investigation was turned over to the fbi so even if i did have access i couldnt report on the details'
p2860
aS'in good news this frees a good 2 hours up to do my work beyond this but i dont even know where to start'
p2861
aS'i contacted a reporter who told me that all of my information was wrong'
p2862
aS'however all of the time i spent gathering the information and doing the research has put me terribly far behind on the rest of my work'
p2863
aS'after getting further information i have retracted my initial statements on the sarkeesian scandal it appears i was wrong'
p2864
aS'well that was a rude response after asking for a clarification of information'
p2865
aS'i sent the email to the washington post now we play the waiting game'
p2866
aS'but i calm down relax and begin to think logically about the situation not morally but logically because morals are terrible things'
p2867
aS'im incredibly cruel and spiteful when im angry sometimes i just wish i didnt listen to my conscience because itd be so satisfying'
p2868
aS'you constantly worried about being forgotten and discarded but you were totally fine with doing it to me how kind'
p2869
aS'im sorry i was asked to explain something and you didnt like the topic but i know you were just looking for a fight anyway'
p2870
aS'im just so glad to see how easily i can be thrown aside after being such a good friend to you'
p2871
aS'dr orgasm will be missed'
p2872
aS'997 fm'
p2873
aS'thats exactly why im doing it'
p2874
aS'im probably just paranoid about it'
p2875
aS'i have screenshots from my phone of the files as well as pictures of the metadata on my computer so hopefully that works'
p2876
aS'so i have to get as much evidence proving the files are real and that theyre at the time i say to prove theyre real'
p2877
aS'the problem is the information im using is some ive collected on my own as audio files so people could say theyre fake'
p2878
aS'indeed also im not even sure if i can make it because i may have either school or work'
p2879
aS'i just turned over all the photos i have from rtx2014 to it took over 200 hours to edit them but its finally\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2880
aS'in good news i may be able to get my ssd today since its probably never going to be lower than today'
p2881
aS'i appreciate it'
p2882
aS'im really worried about this if i got any of my information wrong ill get ruined as a journalist'
p2883
aS'thats horrible id cry'
p2884
aS'good luck brother may the roads rise to meet you'
p2885
aS'but you look so good take pride in that'
p2886
aS'college will be more forgiving'
p2887
aS'its actually assault in the us cuz its unwanted physical contact but its still wrong'
p2888
aS'a one hour commute lies between me amp my college coffee is about the only thing keeping me going right now'
p2889
aS'a shitty place too'
p2890
aS'yes at least in high school'
p2891
aS'even so the women may have or had a right to in this case the accuser has the power nor the offender'
p2892
aS'lt3'
p2893
aS'technically any form of unwanted sexual contact is legally sexual assault trust me i know'
p2894
aS'of people seeing a systemic problem and placing the blame on one wellknown person rather that the real offenders'
p2895
aS'people on the internet have this bad habit of getting offended for people rather than themselves this is one case'
p2896
aS'obviously but to go to the extent of anger people were going to for no real reason is overreacting'
p2897
aS'badassing your way through history 4 us presidents whose lives put action movies to shame crackedvideo '
p2898
aS'god damn'
p2899
aS'jesus thats a fucking song'
p2900
aS'danu pls'
p2901
aS'that girl brings the heat to warm the canadian cold'
p2902
aS'canadian babes always lurking in the library eh'
p2903
aS'i even asked to check for records up to 2 full days before she spoke out and there was absolutely nothing prior'
p2904
aS'the simple fact i was able to be able to request the report at all proves its free to the public except there was no report'
p2905
aS'if it wasnt available it wouldnt be able to be reported on and theres no way a student would get any access'
p2906
aS'police records even during an investigation are available in some form to the public including whether one was even filed'
p2907
aS'actually that was just with police it was 45 in total counting all of the agencies'
p2908
aS'i literally spent 20 minutes in total calling various agencies of san francisco amp theres no record of it at all'
p2909
aS'theres no record of police hearing about any of it before the publication of her statement no one contacted them'
p2910
aS'god is dead nietzsche yes very nice friedrich very inflammatory but what about the cat cant answer me can yo\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2911
aS'no if youre getting threats enough that youre forced out of your home youre supposed to call the police'
p2912
aS'i mean its proof sarkeesian never contacted police so its gonna be bad'
p2913
aS'i can only imagine the hell ahead of me'
p2914
aS'yeah but people have been saying this for awhile amp have been called sexist i have to report on it regardless'
p2915
aS'i shouldnt be surprised about this but for some reason i slightly am mainly because she didnt even bash men in the speech'
p2916
aS'and shes already had this happen to her and she handled it the right way she had tact and class amp no one talks about it anymore'
p2917
aS'why am i the least bit surprised 4chan is targeting emma watson because of her speaking out on gender equality'
p2918
aS'from the fine people who brought you gamergate which was totally about journalistic integrity amp not harassing women'
p2919
aS'also that thing will get hot and youll be lucky to get 34 hours on the battery with the power hog it is'
p2920
aS'you can bring a desktop to college and even then you dont need a 2k beast for a laptop it makes no sense'
p2921
aS'the 800 series isnt so much better than the 700 that youll die without it a gtx 770 will do you perfectly'
p2922
aS'not worth it you can get a way better desktop for less'
p2923
aS'i feel as though nothing good will come from this ive been on the phone with various departments for 45 minutes already'
p2924
aS'exploring deeper into the gamergate problem for a class paper has led me to filing paperwork for the anita sarkeesian police report'
p2925
aS'ill ask for the monitor amp hdmi combo but ill have to wait to buy a new rig later im so sad'
p2926
aS'i could probably get a gtx 770 amp replace the one in this computer then i could put it in my dads desktop to make it better'
p2927
aS'i mean it has less ram than id like amp the gpu is not that great but i could upgrade it so easily'
p2928
aS'theres a pretty good computer monitor and hdmi cable thing i could buy right now for today only for less thank 1k amp i have no money'
p2929
aS'anything for a good friend'
p2930
aS'sorry i kept you in here stephen my bad'
p2931
aS'shes not worth your time and theres no reason she should remain in your life leave her to her games amp you play the good ones'
p2932
aS'she does this cuz she knows she can she has what men want amp uses it to her advantage power to control'
p2933
aS'however at the core of human interaction theres a degree of deception necessary for relationships to form'
p2934
aS'all humans manipulate each other its just that some are more partial to it than others its immature'
p2935
aS'youll do great youre gonna get the job i know it'
p2936
aS'so yes by the structure of this sentence it is in fact a metaphorical statement'
p2937
aS'depending on what an adventure relates to its probably a metaphor for having a free experience with her'
p2938
aS'you are a free spirit is a metaphor on its own its comparing a person to an idea of freedom amp spirituality'
p2939
aS'a metaphor is a comparison amp manufactured relationship to another thought without like or as'
p2940
aS'if you go one source less you fail the paper outright the only good thing is that my topic requires internet sources amp not all scholarly'
p2941
aS'also its a 10 page paper that needs 25 sources ive seen 20 page expose articles with less sources than that'
p2942
aS'why on earth would you need 8 sources for that it makes no sense youre forming a question not half the fucking paper'
p2943
aS'8 apa cited references for a topic question are you fucking kidding me its essentially 34 paragraphs'
p2944
aS'plot twist you were always an old person in your heart'
p2945
aS'bby lt3'

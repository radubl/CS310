aS'i wish you guys wouldnt write off any discussion of gender as a tribal conflict between you and the mra crowd'

aS'i should clarify that i agree theres a real problem i just want to point out that emotions not video games are the cause of it'

aS'i appreciate poking fun at politicians as much as the next guy but i really think jokes a bit stretchyit makes no sense'

aS'but it is the past which is why nerd culture is improving its been adopted or accepted by most younger women'

p385
aS'what the brits should be concerned about is people with british passports who didnt go to iraq theyre in britain after all'

aS'really what cruz is demanding is submission middle easterners in the us should know their place esp in us foreign policy'

aS'i am sure a lot of middle eastern christians are also pretty tired of being dragged into unwanted us or them frames'
p424
aS'half the stuff cruz said is offensive to anyone who listens just because its intolerant and jingoist if for no other reason'
p425
aS'cruz doesnt just offend the crowd by going offtopic but by assuming his view of israel is morally obligatory for everyone'

p430
aS'on a personal note i know what its like to have your illusions about human kindness shattered its genuinely depressing'
p431
aS' and we cant really deal with misogyny in a sensible fashion as long as extremists are dominating the conversation'
p432
aS'people who excuse domestic violence are like the extremist arm of the misogynist crowd its a big spectrum and '
p433
aS'i totally hope people accede to your request it makes me feel terrible that there are so many people like that out there'
p434
aS'so my guess is that the mainstream media didnt want a syria war but do want an iraq war presumably following whs lead'
p435
aS'which is just not true its perfectly possible for the us to fly air support in iraq only indefinately with no escalation'
p436
aS'but with isis everyone in the mainstream media is convinced the only possibly war goal would be total utter annihilation of isis'
p437
aS'with syria or libya the plan was essentially a shortterm war with a limited war goal'
p438
aS'i think its odd how the us media assumes total victory is necessary when they want that to be true and vice versa'
p439
aS'saying you cant have an air war is a total lie it has its limitations but its perfectly possible'
p440
aS'the only real problem with the idea of the caliphate is that its being proposed by roving bands of idiots'

aS'video games have been accused of all kinds of nonsense and video gamers are the butt of a lot of jokes'

aS'that way every relevant interest is ultimately served guess whos not relevant'
p446
aS'they have politicians on then they get ad revenue from corporations who back the politicians who then support the corporations'
p447
aS'i know its a rhetorical question but the reason is that the news media doesnt really care about whats right and wrong'
p448
aS'i dont mean to lay blame or absolve guilt i just want everyone to understand where resentment comes from so we can heal it'
p449
aS'i cant honestly tell whether that was a true belief but i am guessing i wasnt the only one who felt that way'
p450
aS'i never wanted to be resentful but ive always believed women hated me for traits that came to be identified with being a nerd'
p451
aS'i do hope you know that not every misogynist is a bad person i grew up with serious mental illness and video games were a refuge'

p459
aS'ill be happy to tell my grandchildren about how gamers used to be nerds and disliked women'

aS'the problem is that nerds are trying to retain their culture by clinging to resentment when they should be jumping ship'
p461
aS'youre partly right about something nerd culture cannot survive being adopted by women being hated is an integral part of it'
p462
aS'no but i suppose it cant hurt '
p463
aS' that nerds are generally nice people and they dont want to have resentment i think we make excuses to avoid confronting it'

aS'im really frustrated that the gamergaters have been so terrible because it makes me look foolish if i happen to agree with them'
p1876
aS'and i dont think their job is done i just dont want people to think games are still like in the 80s when it was bad'
p1877
aS'regardless of what gamers do or not almost all devs have actually done a great job improving the depth of female character'
p1878
aS'eh forget about it i know its insensible for me to argue about this at the moment im not even defending gamers just devs'

aS'but you just cant say that the villain in a game doing something terrible is equivalent to advocating for that terrible thing'
p1880
aS'ill grant that feminists are rightly annoyed that women are more often portrayed as victims than as heroes'
p1881
aS'my primary reason for saying that is that sarkesians examples of sexism are all examples where sexism is portrayed negatively'
p1882
aS'i am all for feminism having an influence on video games but its already succeeding theres very little sexism left in games'
p1883
aS'duke nukem is a great example of a sexist game although one can argue that theyre making fun of sexism but is way out there'
p1884
aS'there should be more strong women in gaming but that isnt because games are particularly sexist as of this moment'
p1885
aS'but people want to hang onto it using any excuse because they just cant let it go even temporarily'
p1886
aS'which is an interesting topic with complex issues that absolutely no one can deal with rationally right now'
p1887
aS'gamergate is clearly about as your other caller said the intersection between gaming and feminism'
p1888
aS'as ive said we dont all author our own misogyny but theres no excuse for making excuses'

aS'its funny how im defending gamers who are misogynist but i hate it when they claim press freedom nonsense'

aS'i dont think its too unreasonable to say that the south wasnt the norths to keep but im a contrarian'
p1905
aS'its fair to say that the civil war was about slavery but also to say that it was about keeping the south'
p1906
aS'the civil war was not ineviable even after the secession a land invasion of syria is not inevitable despite isis'
p1907

p1909
aS'which might be even more outrageous but islam turned minor tribal distinctions into two separate peoples arabs and jews'

p1911
aS'for one thing the gorilla wasnt a gorilla back then and they also werent that distinguishable from each other'
p1912
aS'its like with evolution itd be silly for one chimp to claim that he descended from one tribe of gorilla but not another'
p1913
aS'the idea that jews even existed as a distinct group in roman times is largely a result of the era after the islamic conquests'
p1914
aS'in which case the israelites are secretly the ancestors of the arabs not that arabs and jews were distinguishable ever'
p1915
aS'theres some chance the entire story of exodus is true but the year before anyone wrote anything down the tribe swiched names'
p1916
aS'the period was utterly chaotic like most unwritten human history it was mostly random we cant know who anyone was'
p1917
aS'theres no reason to believe jews and arabs could be distinguished in ancient times nor that the israelites were the israelites'
p1918
aS'its annoying that the israeli right promotes any theory that suggests jews were a special people back then not really no'
p1919
aS'and egypt at the time was pretty much just a kingdom on the nile who went to war if people didnt send them money regularly'
p1920
aS'but in reality youre dealing with enormous numbers of tribes some of them semitic some not some a mixture its total chaos'
p1921
aS'the mistake early scholars and zealots made is thinking that the ancient world was like modern or even roman civilization'
p1922
aS'or maybe it didnt happen at all but some version of it almost certainly happened to somebody'
p1923
aS'similarly the exodus story could have happened anywhere in the levant but was attached to what we now know as egypt'
p1924
aS'as such what happened in the bibles bethlehem may have been attached to one of several places named or misnamed bethlehem'
p1925
aS'and some of the maps may not have been accurate anyway since places had names in hundreds of languages'
p1926
aS'once they consolidated proper maps they just started arbitrarily attaching biblical names and events to places in the real world'
p1927
aS'almost all of the details of the oldest old testament stories were filled in thousands of years after they may have happened'
p1928
aS'as such the exodus story might have true components whats false is the narrative that developed before archeology did'
p1929
aS'after all palestine was in egypt it wasnt a long walk and the egyptians may not have cared to record distant events'
p1930
aS' during the time of the alledged exodus but wandering for 40 years from egypt to palestine was a fairly common occurence'
p1931
aS'my point is theres no reason to believe anyone was in a position to write anything about the israelites'
p1932
aS'they may have wandered 40 years most people were nomads at the time but they never got near egypt proper'
p1933
aS'its very likely the israelites lived in the massive area of the levant that was part of the ancient egyptian empire'
p1934
aS'by the way the jews in egypt didnt live in egypt they lived in the egyptian empire'

aS'they probably dont like telling you that theyre one of the pathetic people you were just mocking so i do'
p1940
aS'people probably write you guys angry tweets based on their sense that you find them pathetic'
p1941
aS'i didnt sign up to be the pathetic loser is why i dont want to be criticized for it by people i respect'
p1942
aS'sam is more careful about how he mocks people i think he avoids criticizing people for the way they feel'
p1943
aS'i think thats why you guys get all the angry tweets and sam just gets criticized for being a fake jew'
p1944
aS'i know you guys probably meant to mock a particular person whos probably not a virgin but you generalize a lot'
p1945
aS'its practically taboo to admit that youre a 27yearold virgin why should i be depressed and get mocked'
p1946
aS'whats the obvious response guy gets depressed then he gets misogynistic then you mock him some more'
p1947
aS'in other words guy cant find love he gets miserable then other guys tell him hes not a real man'
p1948
aS' one can score points towards becoming nonpathetic'
p1949
aS' it also encourages misogyny by promoting heteronormativity and making sex with women one of a few ways '
p1950
aS'aside from it being hurtful and obnoxious and pointless to mock people for being pathetic '
p1951
aS'i think a huge part of why misogyny occurs is because men cant live up to the standard of being nonpathetic'
p1952
aS'im pathetic is why i was angry too and being told  a millionth time even by progressives  doesnt help'
p1953
aS'i dont mean to rehash it all but it just rubs me the wrong way when you mock people for being pathetic'
p1954
aS'a lot of gamers are sad is why some of us get angry thats what ive been trying to tell you guys'
p1955
aS'i really do think you guys shouldnt make fun of anyone for being sad'
p1956
aS'i always read harris as saying that torture is horrible and that war is just more horrible i guess thats not his position'
p1957
aS'im sorry that youve been criticized for making comments on us gun deaths i hope youll continue to speak out in the future'
p1958
aS'well you know youre an antisemite because you dont know that israelis breed like rabbits what was i saying'
p1959
aS'meaning its probably possible to negate the difference while still eating meat but itll still be less fun'
p1960
aS'a large part of why vegetarians live longer is because they eat fewer calories'
p1961
aS'and yeah i realize im probably criticizing the danish military along with isis and the us army plus the vatican'
p1962
aS'for the same reason its a really bad idea to let your son be an alter boy in a church without female priests'
p1963
aS'my point is if youre a woman and you want to fight youd be an idiot to join any army except israels'
p1964
aS'israels model is ironically the only one that sufficiently prevents rape more women soldiers is always better'
p1965
aS'of course when women arent available undisciplined soldiers tend to rape civilians children and each other'
p1966
aS' of professionalism and discipline to prevent female soldiers from being raped isis is not that professional'
p1967
aS'the reason women have only recently been integrated into militaries is because it takes an extreme level of '
p1968
aS'i dont like making assumptions about people but im pretty sure isis has the moral qualms of ghengis khan'
p1969
aS'anyway a woman who joins isis will last for two perhaps three propaganda videos before shes sold as a slave'
p1970
aS'the reason theyre selling well is because of halloween now you can literally be a sexy nurse with ebola'
p1971
aS'the ebola toy is probably for teaching school kids about microbiota and hygeine'
p1972
aS'i dont mean to argue for or against it but to put it simply its a very persuasive argument to really miserable people'
p1973
aS'anyway the real argument of the gamergate crowd is were mean to women online because theyre mean to us in real life'
p1974
aS'dont miss interview w on his new book pay any price greed power and endless war listen'
p1975
aS'i actually agree with you on gamergate there is no real option of debating the issues while threats are being sent'
p1976
aS'i wonder if the same goes for quest for glory but then i never liked adventure games because i played baldurs gate instead '
p1977
aS'hence if you criticized most anything in bg1 id feel you were expecting something you werent supposed to expect and get annoyed'
p1978
aS'i think its extremely hard to critique an older game because these games shaped so many peoples basic expectations'
p1979
aS'im sure i would design some stuff in bg differently but for me bg is the standard of perfection except when it comes to graphics'
p1980
aS'i am glad youre not doing a playthrough of baldurs gate because id probably end up hating you for every little criticism lol'

aS'goldmann sachs doesnt want the world to burn down neocons serve the arms and oil industries they dont care'

aS'i think the best distinction between neocons and neoliberals is made by saying who they serve and why'

aS'even if telekinesis does exist its simply not proper to believe in it until its been overwhelmingly verified'

p1987
aS'but id be really scared of is the cops i guess a white tourist would be protected but still theyre terrifying'
p1988
aS'then theres the crime rate and the restaurants not paying their workers and the distance and cost'
p1989
aS'frankly the police is 50 of the reason i dont plan to go to america despite wanting to visit'
p1990
aS'the reason an officer intentionally doesnt speak up when making a command is because he wants you to be uncooperative'
p1991
aS'bluetooth doesnt mean youre not on your phone either way this cop seems really dirty'
p1992
aS'i plan to kill myself shortly before i become infirm theres no amount of money id feel okay giving someone for wiping me'
p1993
aS'geez fuck i dont know i wish i could just yell at somebody and this whole thing would go away its worse than depressing'
p1994
aS'this whole thing has made me so damned angry nerds are supposed to be the last bastion of being nice to other people no more'
p1995
aS'i guess my point is i wish the debate could have stayed on the level of art critique because then the nerd wouldve won'
p1996
aS'frankly if you imply that a corpse is supposed to look sexy youve really got to wonder whether your assumptions are wrong'
p1997
aS'also the author of the videos seems to have a very strange perspective on what males find sexually stimulating like corpses'
p1998
aS'are some stuff tropes yeah if its a trope whenever you highlight the horror of say spousal abuse how dare they outrage'
p1999
aS'i mean i just dont see how every reference to women in video games somehow turn out to be secretly oppressive towards women'
p2000
aS'okay so i sat down and watched a tropes vs women video frankly theyre more annoying than anything'
p2001
aS'the bible is just not fundamental to christianity any longer nor is the old testament fundamental to judaism'
p2002
aS'my point is you can be a christian without ever reading the bible or caring whats in it and most christians are'
p2003
aS'thats exactly why fundamentalists dont consider regular christians to be christians they call them atheists'
p2004
aS'you dont understand why people choose to be christians if theyre progressive instead of just being essentially atheists'
p2005
aS'i dont claim to be a christian but i think you should stop holding all christians to a bigoted fundamentalists standard'
p2006
aS'modern christians however are not they have a long philosophical heritage that includes the enlightenment like yours does'
p2007
aS'modern christianity is not really about the texts thats why fundamentalists claim to be literalists'
p2008
aS'that said it is bullshit thats why im ashamed that video gamers are even capable of the stuff some people have done'
p2009
aS'ive realized theres no excuse for it but there are underlying issues that must be addressed for us to get past this bullshit'
p2010
aS'i cant make every gamer read buddhist philosophy so im wondering how i can make them let go of their bitterness too'
p2011
aS'i grew up being told that the reason i was miserable is because women hate video gamers it took me a long time to get over it'
p2012
aS'i am ashamed to see myself in some of the abuse youve gotten i grew up in the era of the really bad stereotype of the nerd'
p2013
aS'im ashamed of whats happened to you ive been a bitter and angry person i am autistic and suffer from chronic depression'
p2014
aS'i forgot what my point was i guess that every culture has an age of heroes who eventually sire civilizeddecadent empires'
p2015
aS'the antidepressants helped too by the way'
p2016
aS'thats definately true i used to be an angry and bitter person it felt good at the time but it wasnt'
p2017
aS'not to say that the cultures were similar but that their expansion was largely a project of spreading civilized culture'
p2018
aS'far from the racist view of the persian empire that saw europe saved by the greeks the persians were much like the franks'
p2019
aS'i guess my point is that societies are complicated but share very universal traits with similarly complex societal structures'
p2020
aS'then theres a much more communalist side to both tribal cultures athens and the norse cities were far more civilized'
p2021
aS'its a lot more like ancient greece sparta had a terrible human rights record but they definately didnt like being subjugated'
p2022
aS'its hardly a libertarian paradise women werent quite as free as men and slaves much less so but its far from feudalism'
p2023
aS'the show really gives you an interesting perspective on the tribal society theres no law its all based on being a free man'
p2024
aS'the old feudal mechanics made no sense for tribes new system needs work but its much more fitting watchthe show vikings btw'

aS'so ragnar invaded west francia with a raid took paris for a ransom and carried off 25 metric tons of silver on prestige alone'

aS'anyway the culture war is over gamers won the problem is many are still angry they had to fight'
p2033
aS'im all for white guilt but not being historically oppressed doesnt mean you cant complain'
p2034
aS'that said i still dont think the culture is something we need to preserve its negative nostalgic'
p2035
aS'the point being you dont have to be black or transgendered to have genuine problems'
p2036
aS'that aside the gamer community  which ive left  has an enormous subsection of mentally ill people'
p2037
aS'ive never said gamers have it as badly as black people or transgendered people but we have feelings'
p2038
aS'for the record i think we should be reluctant to imply white cismale people dont get to whine'
p2039
aS'libertarianism is really a religion pauls article is essentially a prayer in nomine free market'
p2040
aS'gee this ebola thing is starting to become a problem i think maybe we should stop dying in horrible wars'
p2041
aS'i love the fact that paul thinks the locals in west africa havent thought of getting liberty before'
p2042
aS'i still think dharma and greg is the most depressing show ive ever seen i cant believe how it went shattered illusions '
p2043
aS'did you leave the juice in your california sunbaked car i dont have to give you hygeine tips do i '
p2044
aS'i dont care what the guy spends the money on he doesnt need a job to be a good parent same goes for a housewife'
p2045
aS'so everyone whos unemployed should get less child support or just the guys you think shes still single'
p2046
aS'i like realistic historical paintings for the record i dont care who painted a piece only whats in it and why'
p2047
aS'im currently looking for paintings to put on my tv monitor i dont give a rats arse if its a picture of an original or not'
p2048
aS'youre right about ebola being a secondrate illness ebola has nothing on hiv which spreads before symptoms appear'
p2049
aS'i really like the suggestion that this concordat established that territory not just vassal relationships implied nationhood'
p2050
aS'which goes a long way towards explaining why church holdings were tolerated and why the conflict over investiture happened'
p2051
aS'as i understand it this led clergymen who were also welleducated to be counted on for administrative and judicial duties'
p2052
aS'apparently part of the reason the clergy was useful to feudal lords is their relative lack of bias from dynastic ties'
p2053
aS'a wikipedia article only ck2 players can really read and understand'
p2054
aS'im so sick and tired of the general idea that anyone who tries to be politically correct is a coward'
p2055
aS'i for one do not wish to offend muslims because i once did and it hurt his feelings it made me feel bad because im nice'
p2056
aS'it also insinuates that one could not possibly want to avoid offending muslims because offending anyone is sort of rude'
p2057
aS'as if the natural  or only  human tendency is to go about pissing people off for kicks until someone threatens you'
p2058
aS'i wish we could dispel the meme that the only possible reason people have not to offend muslims is that theyre scared'
p2059
aS'paul is right if there was not government to fight the rebels in a civil war thered be no civil war oh wait'
p2060
aS'lest anyone whine yes i know isis is worse but harris was a bigot long before isis showed up'
p2061
aS'but i dont wanna spend my energy denouncing jews i wanna denounce those brown bastards  harris inner voice'
p2062
aS'i was like that once when it came to drugs in retrospect i realize i was a terrible judgmental and irrational person'
p2063
aS'i do hope you dont think im defending it i just cant stand the kneejerk moralism that makes hypocrites out of all of us'
p2064
aS'now im something something and i know why why man because i got high because i got high etc'
p2065
aS'i couldnt get rid of the stress then i got high'
p2066
aS'anyway one of afromans new verses should be i was chronically depressed but then i got high'
p2067
aS'the song doesnt say youre a loser because you do drugs but that drugs shouldnt be all you do'
p2068
aS'i liked afromans original song it wasnt even antidrugs it just cautioned that escapism and duty be balanced'
p2069
aS'im not saying its great im just saying we have to have perspective we cant just make it all taboo and hope for the best'
p2070
aS'and when it comes to people who occasionally watch these videos accidentally or accidentally well that almost all men'
p2071
aS'frankly id say a guy who chronically watches slightlyunderaged girls needs councelling more than he needs a prison sentence'
p2072
aS'my point is we have to have perspective we have to recognize that its worse to watch a 6yearold than a 16yearold'
p2073
aS'obviously we should prevent people from preying on 16yearolds but we cant arrest everyone who saw american beauty'
p2074
aS'whats really perverted watching a 27yearold woman get legally fucked until she has a prolapsed rectum thats perverse'
p2075
aS'and is it only illegal if the video is labeled with the girls age or does everyone have to go to pervert jail now'
p2076
aS'are you saying its correct to put a guy who watches a 16yearold in the same jail as say a serial rapist'
p2077
aS'you guys are making no sense when it comes to the very speculative child porn story'
p2078
aS'thanks for making the reasonable case when it comes to our response to ebola we need to be smart not panicked or scared'
p2079
aS'by the way nigerian email scams are not really from nigeria its a scam remember they lie to you'
p2080
aS'hospitals even private ones have a sacred duty to citizens when it comes to preventing the spread of epidemics'
p2081
aS'frankly if the stories are true this hospital should have been closed for safety violations before this whole problem happened'
p2082
aS'i hope the nurses sue the hell out of the hospital if a hospital cant deal with epidemics its a public safety hazard'
p2083
aS'those two nurses would almost certainly not have been infected if theyd had access to abundant and uptodate safety equipment'
p2084
aS'firstly privatization prevents centralized control and planning in case of emergencies secondly it encourages costcutting'
p2085
aS'im glad you point out that the privatization of healthcare is a problem when dealing with pandemics'
p2086
aS'the crisis is that us hospitals are all forprofit and skimp on safety gear ffs'
p2087
aS'okay ive gotten it out of my system sorry if i seem like a troll but ebola is not a crisis'
p2088
aS' let alone the infinite ways americans die for no good reason mcdonalds and guns all around'
p2089
aS'crisis youve got to be kidding me you know whats a crisis how about aids and tb'
p2090
aS'aaaaahmigod ebola is in the us everyone flee to the bunker and elect the other guy just cause'
p2091
aS'if perry catches a single segment of nonus news hell have done more to prevent ebola than you'
p2092
aS'hes hopefully watching foreign tv where the news dont invoke terror to boost ratings'
p2093
aS'im thinking about this due to the dream defenders ad the repression of africanamericans stinks of us history'
p2094
aS'its like this everywhere but isnt democracy supposed to allow all legal actions the state disagrees with'
p2095
aS'it makes me really sick to see that in the us the cops can suppress demonstrations as if they were illegal'
p2096
aS'frankly the state should not be able to prevent or even opine on demonstrations except to uphold the fire code'
p2097
aS'and we did it to uphold slavery and to fight communism and to keep black people clean of drugs supposedly'
p2098
aS'if everyone is allowed to think and organize freely you cant repress lawful actions in really any way but we do'
p2099
aS'but of course the us has been repressing people for centuries most notably black people and labour movements'
p2100
aS'by the way the idea of repression of citizenry is extremely old republics were invented to prevent it'
p2101
aS'not sure if thats how its defined but god i hope no one defines it as such human interaction is complex enough'
p2102
aS'if asking a girl out can be sexual harassment i can basically never leave my house again'
p2103
aS'im autistic i live in constant terror that women will think im a creep because i have feelings'
p2104
aS'thats how democracynow put it in which case i gotta say its misleading'
p2105
aS'i believe the sexual harassment statistic cited in the restaurant includes being asked on a date'
p2106
aS'its like the guy whos outraged that some random company would send him the porn he ordered at his home address'
p2107
aS'my theory though is that the dude wears pink panties forgot to put on regular underwear and then got embarassed'
p2108
aS'the female equivalent of waking up with pink panties is waking up wearing a strapon'
p2109
aS'that said heres a republicanesque hashtag iamagamer i play europa universalis 4 where every female character is a monarch'
p2110
aS'a lot of gamers have genuine grievances with the world at large but there is no excuse for holding on to bitterness and enmity'
p2111
aS'i do disagree with sarkesian but i am ashamed and horrified that a gamer would threaten anyone'
p2112
aS'the history of early christianity is fascinating it involves mongols the roman empire the dark ages and charlemagnes francia'
p2113
aS'and for the record reformed refers to calvinism which is related to protestantism its got nothing to do with catholicism'
p2114
aS'unlike orthodox christianity it predates the adoption of christianity by the romans by a lot catholicism is the new kid'
p2115
aS'coptic christianity is just about one of the oldest forms of christianity like nestorian christianity'
p2116
aS'i take it the dog wasnt autistic then'
p2117
aS'im autistic too by the way if i had kids id love them regardless of how they were born'
p2118
aS'but most autistic people arent like that and frankly a lot of kids who arent autistic are like that'
p2119
aS'i grant that being a parent to a particularly nonverbal or antisocial kid can be particularly difficult'
p2120
aS'the first thing i say to people whose kids turn out to be autistic is to calm down autistic people are great'
p2121
aS' be forced to fire diplomats who routinely insult the people theyre supposed to make friends with'
p2122
aS'i frankly dont see why the government has a unilateral right to keep diplomatic incompetence secret they should simply'
p2123
aS'given that i live in a country which is used to reward obama campaign fundraisers i can see why us diplomats are morons'
p2124
aS'half the revelations that came out had something to do with some diplomat being incapable of keeping their mouth shut'
p2125
aS'it struck me during the manning leaks how much of the secrecy was intended to cover for diplomats being incompetent'
p2126
aS'ive taken to drinking in order to stave off the shame while im in the company of women why am i telling you this again'
p2127
aS'i only wish i could talk to girls the way i used to now i feel too much shame and guilt and awkwardness'
p2128
aS'if you find someone whos eternally romantic youll get used to it too and then youll be annoyed because hes too romantic'
p2129
aS'i think its fair to expect your husbond or boyfriend to be relatively romantic but its unfair to expect the impossible'
p2130
aS'young guys are romantic because theyll literally do anything or tell you anything to be with you and theyll believe it too'
p2131
aS'when did i stop being a romantic when i had sex on top of that sex gets less and less interesting for hormonal reasons too'
p2132
aS'i was quite the charmer at 17 you know why young people are more romantic because theyre virgins'
p2133
aS'i have a nokia smartphone theyre pretty good phones saves me from buying apple crap'
p2134
aS'hence you can ignore further discussion of gaming and gamers but please dont mock it either'
p2135
aS'as such anyone who complains about the topic is a reactionary either out of bitterness or nostalgia'
p2136
aS'ive decided that gamers having won the culture war the culture should be discontinued'
p2137
aS'then of course the relations decrease over time again until they cancel the new relationship too and so on'
p2138
aS'so they cancel it eventually but then theyre offered a slightly more favourable variant of the relationship which they accept'
p2139
aS'as relations decrease the extent to which the transferrer thinks the relationship is worth keeping decreases too'
p2140
aS'the ai cancels and renews transfers of trade power because its a variable relationship'
p2141
aS'its not a pretty definition but its the only one that explains the phenomena youve been talking about recently'
p2142
aS'by this definition there have been very few women gamers and literally no popular gamers'
p2143
aS'by the way i use the term gamer as its original meaning a person  usually male  who plays video games and is reviled'
p2144
aS'italy was the center and starting point of the renaissance why do they identify with a colonialist slaveholder'
p2145
aS'i had to let go of feminism or of gaming culture well gaming culture may have been useful but now only the negativity remains'
p2146
aS'thanks for being my sounding board i think ive gotten rid of the cognitive dissonance thats been plaguing me for weeks'
p2147
aS'its a brave new world we won the culture war why do we keep fighting because fighting gave us meaning its foolish'
p2148
aS'i despise what my fellow gamers have done but i see myself in it i think ive decided that gamer culture should be dead to me'
p2149
aS'i dont know why i started writing you im glad gamers are going away but it means letting go of my own identity too'
p2150
aS'but that doesnt mean im not conflicted i hope people get to where i am i hope they can forgive and forget'
p2151
aS'all the griping  and most of my tweets  are the dying gasp of gamer culture i am often ashamed of my cultural compatriots'
p2152
aS'for the record i am really quite glad that gamer culture is dying theres no real benefit to keeping bitter subcultures alive'
p2153
aS'i dont pretend that my depression was caused by women scorning my interest in video games but damn did it hurt at the time'
p2154
aS'thanks for replying to me it helps me combat the voice in my head telling me youre just another person who thinks im scum'
p2155
aS'which means i may be wrong i just wanted you to know that these cultural issues touch more people than you expect'
p2156
aS'i wouldnt ask the same for most other groups except the groups i feel like my less enlightened self was part of'
p2157
aS'i guess im saying itd be nice if you didnt ridicule people based on their sentiment but based on their actions'
p2158
aS'during the mra debate you two made me realize that i carried misogynist sentiment despite being a lifelong feminist'
p2159
aS'i dont abide by harassment i am mostly talking about your listeners who get defensive including me about this topic'
p2160
aS'so i suppose i have to beg please please dont mock people who dont know how to overcome resentment'
p2161
aS'i am frustrated because i know theres nothing i can write that will make you take me seriously'
p2162
aS'i know youre not interested in dealing with the culture of lingering resentment but mocking it just deepens it'
p2163
aS'you can tell me im being unmanly if you wish but gamers have feelings and you cant expect us to love ridicule'
p2164
aS'its sad because i know you dont understand the sentiment and i know youre just making people more angry'
p2165
aS'its taken me many years to lose this anger when you two talk about gaming it makes me really sad'
p2166
aS'i dont give a crap about gamergate but gamers used to be reviled as a result theyre frustrated or angry'
p2167
aS'its technically true but liking rap in 2014 is a very different thing than liking it back when it was seedy'
p2168
aS'saying everyone is a video gamer is sort of like saying everyone likes rap'
p2169
aS'if harris went around telling chronically depressed people to blow themselves up for atheism hed find candidates aplenty'
p2170
aS'theres a reason alqaeda recruits are often mentally ill its a lot easier to train a suicide bomber whos suicidal'
p2171
aS'people who say atheists dont do suicide bombings need to realize that atheists constantly commit suicide'
p2172
aS'then theres the gating mechanism of having a respected editor pick the editorials surely they must be doing it well'
p2173
aS'perhaps its from the theory that since there are many blogs you dont have time to read them all so why bother'
p2174
aS'they tell you what shows to promote they tell you what graphics to use whatll they tell you tomorrow'
p2175
aS'they tell you how long videos should be what the titles should be what type of stuff to talk about'
p2176
aS'i love you but you did give someone editorial control theyre called youtube'
p2177
aS'i dont think columbus is the original hitler  a lot of people held slaves  but cmon he was no saint'
p2178
aS'the fucking renaissance started in italy but some slaveholding colonial governor  of spains  is their hero'
p2179
aS'cant believe italians are butthurt over columbus italy has a hundred great people to celebrate'
p2180
aS'tsar would not be a title if julius caesar hadnt had the richest moneylender in rome buying armies for him'
p2181
aS'fun history note know how kings got installed theyd usually need institutional aristocratic and financial support'
p2182
aS'the dimwits at fox dont even know that the tzars were emperors not kings'
p2183
aS'mostly hed just invent his own religion and start a heresy and lose a ton of prestige when having to convert back'
p2184
aS'to be fair it wasnt too bad he was a genius his claim was not disputed and most fits of insanity could be rectified'
p2185
aS'long story short he killed his brother  my less genius heir  and became emperor and invited a british coven to tartaria'
p2186
aS'i decided that the boy  who id happily made my heir when it turned out he was a genius  should probably not rule'
p2187
aS'i didnt take it seriously until one night my character woke up one night with the boy sitting on him holding a knife'
p2188
aS'i wrote it off and forgot it for a while then people started reporting being attacked in the middle of the night'
p2189
aS'when he had a son he started hearing rumours that the boy was possessed i asked a priest who said it was rubbish'
p2190
aS'i eventually got my heir back to the persian zoroastrian roots id conveniently abandoned then he inherited my realm'
p2191
aS'i started out normally but khiva was invaded i swore fealty to the king of georgia who kept trying to convert me'
p2192
aS'i had the most ridiculous ck2 game once i started out as a zoroastrian count and ended up forming tartaria achievement'
p2193
asS'2014_41'
p2194
(lp2195
S'i probably should send you some money but i frankly have nearly no money ill do it sooner or later though'
p2196
aS'if i could help fill up a bar on your kickstarter page though id know exactly what my contribution would do'
p2197
aS'i would probably pay a buck a show to get more shows but then id have no way to know if it helped'
p2198
aS'if you guys put up some kind of donation goal short of a million you might get people donating to get more show'
p2199
aS'i hope theres some kind of secret law that says in case of a pandemic the govt will round up cowardly doctors'
p2200
aS'i rarely blame people for being cowards but medical workers are smart smart cowards deserve to get shot seriously'
p2201
aS'its like a firefighter deciding not to show up when theres a house fire who the f else do they think will show up'
p2202
aS'if i hear one more story of a medical worker refusing to show up for work because of ebola ill throw a fit'
p2203
aS'to be fair in the case of the americans who refuse to seek treatment a lot of them would risk bankruptcy in the past'
p2204
aS'this is why slums in the us have tuberculosis this is why west african conspiracy theorists are likely to get killed'
p2205
aS'people who are too scared to go to the hospital or show up for work at hospitals are the people who spread disease'
p2206
aS' but thats not be very funny my point is people need to stop panicking or the panick will help ebola spread'
p2207
aS'id make a comment on how america might not be safe after all because of a lack of sanitation and healthcare'
p2208
aS'the only way ebola would be dangerous is if doctors and nurses stop coming to work because theyre fing pussies'
p2209
aS'it spreads in societies where the victims of disease are treated at home or go untreated'
p2210
aS'ebola simply doesnt spread in societies with good hygeine awareness sanitation and a healthcare system'
p2211
aS'some republicans talk about ebola like that guy in every zombie movie who panicks and gets eaten by zombies'
p2212
aS' the difference being that the cops have connections to the prosecutors and judges and press so they get away with it'
p2213
aS'so youve got the cops and the cribs and the bloods all trying to take over your neighbourhood '
p2214
aS'its abundantly obvious why a lot of people see the cops as just a better uniformed gang who want prestige and territory'
p2215
aS'i dont know that i could go to an american restaurant i think id end up trying to start a protest'
p2216
aS'and the whole masterservant show being put on at restaurants goes entirely to benefit the corporate coffer'
p2217
aS'it reminds me of the old days in denmark when servants had virtually no rights and had to please their masters'
p2218
aS'the whole thing strikes me as kind of sick waiters are made to put on a performance for the customers'
p2219
aS'theyre then demoralized and stressed by being made to grovel for tips since their employer doesnt pay them'
p2220
aS'in the us waiters can be paid less than the minimum wage in other words much of their pay is optional'
p2221
aS'seriously though the best way to improve service is to improve the job for example by paying a wage'
p2222
aS'then his waiter friends ganged up on me and kicked me while i was lying on the ground then i paid and went home'
p2223
aS'we dont tip in denmark we have terrible service last night the waiter punched me in the groin'
p2224
aS'yeah fuck people who would die for their beliefs like that bastard george washington'
p2225
aS'ive known a lot of women who thought they were less attractive than they were and its terrible the same goes for men too'
p2226
aS'i think part of the reason people tell you youre attractive is because they fear you dont know it'
p2227
aS'i just think its unfair that theres a penis in every vagina but theres not a vagina on every penis '
p2228
aS'of course the clitoris is like a penis where do you think penises come from they dont materialize from nothing'
p2229
aS'guys do have to be in a certain mental state to orgasm its not like we do it on command or can do it in any situation'
p2230
aS'1920s version of fox news you know women they dont care about politics like men do should they really vote'
p2231
aS'if this wasnt obscene it would be hilarious whats next they already have pink guns how about pink tobacco'
p2232
aS'and yes i dont think its wrong of me to think the invasion of normandy should be reflected upon with some kind of human emotion'
p2233
aS'like im not saying you have to start sobbing but its not an arcade game its not meant to be shallow and fast and flashy'
p2234
aS'whats the most fun way to play the game taking it seriously is a lot more fun than sitting around complaining that its not sc2'
p2235
aS'im not a grumpy old man but watching you go ohmygod the controls are slow im bored while storming normandy is unnerving'
p2236
aS'your riflemen can also steal abandoned enemy guns or mgs or bazookas or even heavy artillery cheaper than building them'
p2237
aS'i suggest investing in antitank guns for these areas instead remember that if the crew gets killed you can recrew it quickly'
p2238
aS'placing them on the main road in a battlefield where all the enemy tanks come by is kind of a waste'
p2239
aS'oh one more thing placing mg nests is much more effective to guard distant points where the enemy wont focus'
p2240
aS'i dont know if im helping or annoying you'
p2241
aS'i think youre really lucky you havent put your almostunarmored cars up against enemies focusing on antitank weaponry yet p'
p2242
aS' and then you let your armored cars fight enemy tanks when its usually better to scrounge up an at gun at least for support '
p2243
aS'youre not playing like total crap but you miss opportunities in the early game to take out enemy infantry with your armored cars'
p2244
aS' it should flee to fight another day tanks can take enemy tanks but arent costeffective against at infantry and at guns'
p2245
aS'a light vehicle can take out a hundred mgs but when a tank or antitank gun shows up or infantry with antitank weapons '
p2246
aS'when using vehicles in coh you should be very aggressive against mgs and very cautious against enemies with antiarmor capacity'
p2247
aS'its a bit ridiculous to say that orthodox christianity is the reason why all the soviet countries were orthodox'
p2248
aS' iraq saudi arabia and afghanistan than islam the same is probably true for communism too'
p2249
aS'look for some justification for harbouring negative thoughts there are way more important common denominators between'
p2250
aS'people who choose to categorize those countries as being muslim rather than some secular distinction seem to want to'
p2251
aS'wait a minute gretchen i thought the government was not supposed to be in charge of healthcare'
p2252
aS'the people who recoil in horror at state religion are americans who are routinely ruled by religious fanatics'
p2253
aS'most people dont even care about whether theres a state religion or not in denmark or morocco or anywhere'
p2254
aS'my point is it doesnt matter if muslim countries all have state religions its such a pointless distinction'
p2255
aS'even governments with no state religions are often run by parties that are explicitly aggressively religious'
p2256
aS'denmark has a state religion the uk has a state religion that doesnt mean theyre theocracies'
p2257
aS'i heard you support campaign finance reform youre becoming a regular civil rights legend you know '
p2258
aS'thanks for the reply i should buy some seeds and find out maybe its not like its gonna kill me'
p2259
aS'christians also did colonialism the 1953 coup and the iraq war when did christians stop the crusades again'
p2260
aS'not getting laid is no joke it causes serious mental illness i should know i once wanted to bring a gun to school'
p2261
aS'ill shut up now i hope i didnt sound incomprehensible i dont know how to explain to people that love is the way foward'
p2262
aS'but any philosophy worth having is one which must be constantly reinforced lest we get lazy and thus selfish'
p2263
aS'i also dont believe people become humanists for religious reasons any more than they become tribalists'
p2264
aS' is a philosophy that makes the world better atheists can be humanists but they certainly dont have a monopoly on it'
p2265
aS'to be clear i dont think atheists cant love their enemies but any philosophy that teaches this kind of love '
p2266
aS' and its not even just tolerable or even simply preferable to love ones enemies is obligatory'
p2267
aS'hitchens said that it is evil to love ones enemies but he was an evil man to love ones enemies is not just not evil '
p2268
aS'anyway the only thing ive changed my belief on is this religion does do good in the world hitchens showed this'
p2269
aS'i do believe in barbarians but i remember that my people were once barbarians and we didnt become civilized by force'
p2270
aS'i see harris as a modern version of the british aristocracy bemoaning the white mans burden of civilizing the barbarians'
p2271
aS'i reject that atheism is a religion whenever its called a religion people are really talking about neoconservatism'
p2272
aS'and of course when atheists act tribalist its because of atheist exceptionalism which is grounded in the enlightenment'
p2273
aS'when christians act tribalist its because tribalism is human when muslims do it its because of the quran'
p2274
aS'it doesnt seem to occur to them that maybe the behaviour of certain people is determined by common human psychology'
p2275
aS'the reason i think thats their motivation is because their stereotype is the one thing they never question'
p2276
aS'even if i agreed with his statements i just cannot align myself with people who are motivated by their dislike of others'
p2277
aS'harris is probably the reason why i no longer identify as an atheist his atheism is based on antimuslim sentiment'
p2278
aS'youre doing well with the offmap artillery by the way the game is very much about throwing munitions at your problems '
p2279
aS'i highly recommend you try the air command its got great ways to spend munitions plus paratroopers are really quite good'
p2280
aS'you did build a howitzer lt3 if you protect a howitzer it can blow the enemy bases to hell from half the map away'
p2281
aS'i really think you should take more time to look at the things you unlock with cps you must build 105mm howitzer its hilarious'
p2282
aS'coh was ridiculously ahead of its time i once had an airplane shot down it fell on the enemy hq and blew it up lol'
p2283
aS'the reason i think harris is a bad guy is his insinuation that legitimate democratic activity by muslims is also undemocratic'
p2284
aS'i would be happy with harris and maher if they talked about particulars instead of generalizing'
p2285
aS'additionally they dont seem to take into account that religion is often affected by local conditions poverty creates extremism'
p2286
aS'we all know that some people are more fundamentalist some just go along to get along and some read it as metaphor'
p2287
aS'maher and harris seem not to recognize that muslims have a similar relationship with islam as christians do with their religion'

p2292
aS'i dont know that ive ever seen a credit card debit cards sure and some of them can be used for credit but no one ever does'
p2293
aS'i dont want to put too fine a point on it but do americans really use credit cards to the extent i keep hearing'
p2294
aS'rangers and paratroopers can both kill tanks and infantry which makes them not suddenly lose a fight when an enemy tank shows up'
p2295
aS'rangers are another great infantry unit in case you go for infantry command instead of air command'
p2296
aS'if you base a strategy on strong infantry and use tanks just for lategame assaults you have a lot less micromanaging'
p2297
aS'if the game is too hectic a tactic based on versatile units is often a good idea some infantry paratroopers get antitank guns'
p2298
aS'almost no matter what strategy you go for get all barracks upgrades sticky bombs are your friend bars are awesome'
p2299
aS'control points are always in the open so build a very smal line of sand bags next to them to make them defensible'
p2300
aS'by the way sandbags are free so if you get defensive operations you should be placing them everywhere you might position troops'
p2301
aS'any case i highly recommend building permanent artillery emplacements with your engineers after buying the option with com points'
p2302
aS'i think you should play some of the campaign some missions are a bit tedious but many are really awesome'
p2303
aS'my playstyle is quite defensive theres always the option of trying to rush i imagine rifles flamethrowers and mortars are good'
p2304
aS'tip mg nests dont cost supply so you can build a lot of them you can even put extra troops inside them like an extra mg team'
p2305
aS'once your enemy cant get to your victory points without fielding tanks and artillery your game gets a lot simpler'
p2306
aS'my coh strategy is to block off roads and other access points using mg nests and sandbags then assault enemy positions with tanks'

p2317
aS' with heteronormativity obviously gay people and feminists dont like it but neither do a lot'
p2318
aS'i think theres a lot of people who sympathize with the mra crowd because theres a frustration'
p2319
aS'maybe the fox news anchor doesnt realize that black people usually didnt get the chance to go back to west africa'
p2320
aS'im kidding of course i do see the mistake though since a lot of santeria followers are of west african origin'

aS'the fact is islam spread specifically to certain areas based on geographical and economic reasons'
p2336
aS'that doesnt take away responsibility but its fairly obvious that islam is not the only factor involved'
p2337
aS'the muslim countries that have problems are all enormously poor and wartorn the rest are former colonies'
p2338
aS'doesnt mean they want to be hypocrites some might want to abuse their position some just want to meet a nice wife'
p2339
aS'its perfectly natural that guys who seek attention and positions of influence have many motivations including sex'
p2340
aS'i once wanted to be a priest half of it was because id be able to find a wife that way too bad i was an atheist'

p2350
aS'people arent against sex because they want to control them they want to control them because sex simply outrages them'
p2351
aS'i think control is the wrong term when it comes to restriction of birth control its about sexual honour'
p2352
aS'if the president reads my tweets i want to make sure i point out that i think hes a nice guy but he really needs to be more divisive'
p2353

p2355
aS'if a corporation doesnt pay taxes its usually legal even if its not you cant put a corporation in jail'
p2356
aS'frankly its probably a lot easier to collect taxes and avoid fraud if you tax people who can be prosecuted'
p2357
aS'but we tax the owners for other stuff anyway and its not like corporations dont hide their money'
p2358
aS'i am guessing the idea of corporate taxes is that its simpler to tax a coporation than all its owners'
p2359
aS'thats not a bad point we might as well tax billionaire ceos and stockholders rather than faceless entities'
p2360
aS'journalists are never gonna be satisfied until theyre bored so you have to keep taking questions until they leave'

aS'reassuing the public about their potentially imminent death is not something you squeeze in between meetings'
p2363
aS'i feel like calming down a room full of journalists worried about ebola should be assumed to last all day'
p2364
aS'i realize that the media doesnt exactly give time for lengthy debate but a lot of issues can be explained quickly'
p2365
aS'i think voters are much more likely to respond well if you just talk to them like theyre human persons'

aS'i admit im mildly annoyed when great people like boil complex issues down to talk points'

p2394
aS' which puts them in constant contact with bodily fluids'

aS'i cant look into your soul but your ideological compatriots seem to want to be hurtful thats why people think youre a dick'
p2397

aS'firstly being atheist means that you arent obliged to attack anyone we didnt elect you pope of atheism dont give us orders'

aS'of course if a huge truck hits a bus thats a problem but its very hard not to notice a bus so they dont get hit a lot'
p2407
aS'secondly passengers in buses are situated higher than most cars are tall meaning the damage doesnt reach passengers'
p2408
aS'theres two reason momentum a force that can tear apart a car will barely shake a bus'
p2409
aS'but to reiterate a city bus almost cant be involved in an accident that causes serious personal harm'
p2410
aS'when driving outside of cities busses drive much faster and might go offroad during an accident which can be dangerous'
p2411
aS'that said there are instances where busses would be safer with seat belts so i do think they should be available'
p2412
aS'its extremely unlikely for busses to get hit in the first place and a bus being hit by cars isnt dangerous to passengers'

aS' who are now being failed by the game because its wasting their time without teaching them what mmos used to teach kids'
p2421
aS'which theyre not of course but apparently blizzard are because they completely ruined the game for the sake of the kiddies'
p2422
aS'a game like world of warcraft was legitimately challenging and stimulating before blizzard realized 12yearolds are brainless'
p2423
aS'is a huge part of the reason i hate video games marketed to children theyre all mindless wasting opportunity for kids to learn'
p2424
aS'i dont wanna sound like an old man but i feel like kids can learn anything if you can just keep their attention focused on it'
p2425
aS'i also played the original victoria back when i was like 12 and barely knew english it wasnt easy but i was pretty bright'

p2432
aS'i am really looking forwards to having kids im gonna start educating the kid from day one he or she will be a genious'
p2433
aS'i agree with you about teaching the history of stuff people are interested in but it requires very personalized teaching'
p2434
aS' everyone leads to the worst kind of simplistic nonsense americans are known for'
p2435
aS'the idea is some people have to know history but it doesnt have to be everyone and trying to teach history to '
p2436
aS'this would also prepare kids better for high school and college and save a bunch of money on useless history teaching'
p2437
aS' interested then you can teach on a much higher level of complexity and bring in both sides of these issues'
p2438
aS'no homework necessary no grades its supposed to be a taste then you offer history as an elective of kids who are'
p2439
aS' history for about one grade probably 6th bring in everything the simple the complex the ancient the recent'
p2440
aS' so because we have to teach really lowlevel silly stuff in the earlier grades instead i think we should teach'
p2441
aS' view of history and of events as such it isnt necessarily necessary to teach every kid a full course especially'
p2442
aS'it seems that teaching bad history ei indoctrination is worse than teaching no history because it gives kids a false'
p2443
aS'i wrote you a bunch of tweets and then realized i had a much better idea follows'
p2444
aS'i would seriously consider teaching history for a very short period then making anything further an elective'
p2445
aS'that said youre totally right about stuff like the history of cars and such unfortunately we cant tutor kids individually'
p2446
aS'in the first couple of grades i would have a more daily life sort of theme more context and less drama'
p2447
aS' ei the context sink in gradually rather than being presented as if anyone cared'
p2448
aS'but history should at its core be about why people make the choices they make i would focus on that and let the setting'
p2449
aS'i dont imagine this would reach every kid but it doesnt have to all i ever learned is about vasco da gama and plows'
p2450
aS'its then up to the kids to figure out why certain people did certain things or guess at what people eventually did'
p2451
aS'i imagine history after the 3rd grade could be turned into a kind of debate class where you find real world scenarios'
p2452
aS' of history not any of the facts who cares who wrote the constitution what matters is whats in it and why'
p2453
aS'history is complicated extremely so the purpose of history classes in school is for kids to learn the method and reason'
p2454
aS'exempting early grades i would have all the great crises and debates in world history explained in their full context'
p2455
aS'the fact that history isnt strictly used for anything means we can make it arbitrarily complex'

p2492
aS'that mgiht be true i dont frankly care i just dont understand why this isnt just a death penalthy story'
p2493
aS'or is it because the killer in this case writes a charismatic letter and then everyone assumes iran is antiwomen'
p2494
aS'so literally why is this a story because we dont like the death penalthy because iran has poor due process'
p2495
aS'i mean we usually dont accept a killers rationale without question unless we want to iranbash i guess'
p2496
aS'a person was executed for murder after killing someone in a state with the death penalthy why is this a story'

aS'im sure texas has executed several women who killed men due to alleged crimes against them'

p1608
aS'it came from a source that suggested offering solids at 46 months amp anything before 6 is really early'
p1609
aS'if theyre getting solids water may be necessary to avoid constipation but im unsure how true that is'
p1610
aS'you dont want them to fill their stomachs and drink less milk even in hot conditions breast milk is sufficient to hydrate'
p1611
aS'i feel like its definitely no water for six months and if you assume no major solids intake you dont want them filling up on it'
p1612
aS'i was surprised that the lactation doc was pretty pro solids for b but she said early mobility has a big impact on it'
p1613
aS'i guess most sources are assuming no significant solid intake before 12 months which was true with a'
p1614
aS'not that she is but its likely she will be in a few months as mobile as she is according to the lactation doc'
p1615
aS'really ive read that you probably should offer water if theyre significantly taking in solids to prevent constipation'

aS'i guess shes old enough for solids so'

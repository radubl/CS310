aS'i have no words for disappointed i am in gamers right now i dont see how they can even call themselves people'
p1808
aS'the people bitching about bayonetta 2 are fucking disgusting kudos to for giving the wii u a solid 3rd party exclusive'
p1809

aS'of being forced in to the same group as a bunch of overlyentitled brats when all i usually expect from a game is that it runs'
p1814
aS'im not saying that pc gamers arent stupid and some of them really could use a smack across the face with the reality stick but im tired'
p1815
aS'i only expect as much from a game as the developers tell me im going to get is it wrong of me to expect that'

p1818

p1831
aS'the game forces you in to against wave after wave of borderline bulletproof clones the game is at its best when its letting you climb'
p1832

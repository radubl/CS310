p268
aS'well yeah but i dont mind you being disrespectful of me'
p269
aS'i dont mind if its disrespectful books are important'
p270
aS'not that adult does most of the time adult fiction can be reaaaaallllllly shallow'
p271
aS'im splitting hairs because i think this is really important ya and na simply cant go into the depth adult can'
p272
aS'both of which i find eyeballmeltingly boring in most cases'
p273
aS'there is something about modern na that the na market expects and that makes it stand apart from adult'
p274
aS'thats exactly what i mean though you have to distinguish from a marketing standpoint'
p275
aS'okay then how do you tell it apart if its not the voice and its not the depth and its not the themes'
p276
aS'and anyway who said anything about lower quality i just meant that its less difficult'
p277
aS'as you say some teenagers have adult comprehension but thats not what modern yana is about'
p278
aS'i read crime and punishment in the original russian when i was eighteen'
p279
aS'i give teenagers plenty of credit i read anna karenina when i was thirteen'
p280
aS'because you have to see eyetoeye with an adult author above the head of your teenage narratorprotagonist'
p281
aS'also when i say read i mean read and thoroughly comprehend you need to be an adult to really get catcher in the rye'
p282
aS'writing for a teenager or for a new adult is not the same as writing as one'
p283
aS'imo that thing has to do with the thematic approach as well as voice its simply more difficult to read books like citr'
p284
aS'my point is there is something that distinguishes books like citr from modern yana which is why theyre genres'
p285
aS'catcher in the rye is an adult book but it was written from the pov of a teenager about those themes why is it adult'
p286
aS'thats not the right kind of answer what i mean is what distinguishes your work as na rather than adult just theme'
p287
aS'if youre not holding anything back and youre not changing your voice to suit your audience why arent you in adult'
p288
aS'so whats the distinction between na and adult then'
p289
aS'make modern ya more of a genre than a category ya like the golden compass is ya in category but not genre imo'
p290
aS'i understand but i dont entirely agree imo the similarities of audience and voice between different kinds of ya'
p291
aS'fine whatever category then'
p292
aS'na welli think what that means given what ive seen is adult themes written in a mostly ya voice'
p293
aS'a smart teenager is still a teenager and the adult audience members wont accept it as ya if its written for adults'
p294
aS'but you have to so that your work fits the genre'
p295
aS'i dont like writing yana because i specifically do not want to make it easy on my readers i want to challenge them'
p296
aS'to be clear i dont mean smartness as an intrinsic characteristic i mean smartness as a combo of potential amp knowledge'
p297
aS'thats the entire point of the genre to have lower expectations of knowledge not smarts necessarily'
p298

p308
aS'yes they had close predecessors but its easy to pick out a yana of new and distinguish it from what used to be ya'
p309
aS'so okay i think fiction in general has become less formal and recent yana are actually brand new categories'

aS'because i spent my formative years there i think of myself as a londoner when i get out of the airport the air smells like home'

p724
aS'but i guess there are people who think about being rich or famous or whatever'
p725
aS'ie for me the best part of writing is looking down and thinking i cant believe i did that how did i do that'
p726
aS'ill be honest with you i emotionally identify with plagiarists about as much as i do with idk racists or cabbages'
p727
aS'in that case i guess it was more important to hold the author to standards than to preserve the message'
p728
aS'what would you do in this situation its kind of like that million little pieces scandal except smaller and plagiarism'
p729
aS'on the other hand the blog post clones are good posts and helped me think about an important topic in a different way'
p730
aS'to me its worse for someone to plagiarise than it would be for me to mistakenly accuse'
p731
aS'my problem is that both posts are about an extremely sensitive topic calling one or the other author out as a plagiarist is not an option'
p732
aS'my purpose is not to name anyone or link anything i just want to open the granted somewhat empty floor to commentary'
p733
aS'i just read a post by someone that mirrors exactly a post that told me about a few weeks ago'

p873
aS'well i would recommend my own book except that its not for sale and thats crass anyway'

aS'it really does lt3'
p875
aS'anyway the lesson i learnt was horses can kill you be very very frightened of them'
p876
aS'she was right i guess not sure what the knock to my head did'
p877
aS'my mum was like you seemed fine so i just let you sleep it off nice one mum'
p878
aS'last thing i remember was bright white rocks on the trailand then i woke up eight hours later in the back of a car'
p879
aS'i got scraped up all along one side and hit my head but no broken bones'
p880
aS'most of the time i forget that i got thrown off a horse as a teen it was going at a dead run'
p881
aS'i saw you tweet you online for business or can you spare a chat'
p882
aS'being a spy in jockworld'
p883
aS'this makes me happy its like having a secret identity'
p884
aS'coffee shop jocks have no idea that im listening to black metal im dressed in notgoth today'
p885
aS'yep yep'
p886
aS'im a londoner but right now i live in the states yeah '
p887
aS'nah its only 11pm or so this is early for me '
p888
aS'yes ugh'
p889
aS'its really interesting and scary'
p890
aS'lt3 thank you'
p891
aS'do i not have enough autonomy as a person to be able to declare what i dodont believe'
p892
aS'this feels like something i experience a lot i say i dont believe in any kind of god and im told yeah you do'
p893
aS'so people without a corpus collossum have two minds in a single head they claim to experience one consciousness but dont'
p894
aS'im a phenomenologist meaning i think that consciousness is an illusion that emerges from having a brain'
p895
aS'i dont understand what you mean by this'
p896
aS'yeah but i mean i dont believe in souls or spirits'
p897
aS'i completely disagree i have no religion at all in my life'
p898
aS'so far i havent come across anything in my life that would support any belief in the supernatural i cant help my conclusion'
p899
aS'id have to have new information for my beliefs to change though i cant change my beliefs based on the information i have'
p900
aS'oh man i dont blame you for venting i vent all the time i think im just trying to be a quiet little voice'
p901
aS'so you think i could choose to be religious'
p902
aS'recd'
p903
aS'i guess the tone of those tweets hit me badly because even though i dont agree with a lot of vocal atheists i appreciate them'
p904
aS'given what i knowbelieve already i cant force myself to believe in the supernatural its out of my control'
p905
aS'no i mean given a set of assumptions or facts you believe a claim or you dont'
p906
aS'to stretch it further i dont agree with some people who are very vocal feministsbut i sure as hell appreciate their efforts'
p907
aS'its a really inaccurate analogy but im describing my emotions so it doesnt have to make perfect sense hahah'
p908
aS'similarly being born a woman is not a choice so those tweets felt sort of like tweets that began evangelizing feminists'
p909
aS'i think you can choose to be informed in your beliefs from any sources you like but i dont think what you believe is choice'
p910
aS'heres how those tweets felt to me and its kind of a long argument so bear with me i dont think belief is a choice'
p911
aS'but i hate a hard sell'
p912
aS'yeah same i do like to hear people reason out their beliefs and its good if the argument is convincing on its own'
p913
aS'i got that quaint was sarcastic but i wasnt sure whether thanks for telling me was sarcastic as well'
p914
aS'im not sure whether this is sarcastic or not im sorry'
p915
aS'vocal atheists are shouting to be heard above the tide'
p916
aS'the difference between them is this religious proselytising backs up beliefs already held by most people'
p917
aS'i do experience oppression as a result of my beliefsnot because i evangelise but because of what i believe'
p918
aS'people who have faith in a religion are the vast majority at the moment my atheism makes me the minority'
p919
aS'to me quaint feels like an ad hominem'
p920
aS'to me this tweet feels a little like the privileged majority position badgering the minority'
p921

aS'im tempted to keep yakking but i dont want to plan your story for you sorry'
p1811
aS'right the vial would have to be made out of lead or heavily lined with lead'
p1812
aS'magic all the way then my recommendation would be that the vial hold a stupidly radioactive element to account for the excess'
p1813
aS'sad trombone'
p1814
aS'the problem is that even wheavy water you get weird chemical effects it doesnt work the same way water does'
p1815
aS'or the weird alternate universe in which some things are made of isotopes even protein chains'
p1816
aS'me too i love the radioactive dragon concept'
p1817
aS'plus in order for this to be conscious it would have to be able to set off the reaction at will'
p1818
aS'plus it would have to find a way to make them isotopes again if it wanted to be heavier again'
p1819
aS'but as earlier it would be a secret loss the dragon would be just as large but less dense'
p1820
aS'by giving off neutron radiation wo the elements changing into other elements'
p1821
aS'if the dragon were made of all isotopes formed into molecules which would be crazy unstable it could lose a lot of mass'
p1822
aS'not reallywhen you split heavy elements they often become other elements'
p1823
aS'oh and also heavy water is dangerous as hell if you drink enough of it you die your cells cant use it'
p1824
aS'like a spy novel link for interest'
p1825
aS'its super cool there was this amazing historical event during wwii that revolved around heavy water the atomic bomb'
p1826
aS'but how the hell youd explain all that without infodumpingno clue'
p1827
aS'extrapolate that and you could have a dragon made up of heavy versions of molecules'
p1828
aS'you can make water with it but its heavy water this stuff literally sinks to the bottom of the ocean'
p1829
aS'theres this stuff called deuterium which is hydrogen but with one more neutron its pretty stable so it exists in nature'
p1830
aS'atoms make up molecules and you can have heavy molecules that are made up of unusual isotopes instead'
p1831
aS'theres one more scenario that you could use but i have no idea how'
p1832
aS'very short answer youll have to do handwaving anyway so its up to you whether you just make it all up or only some of it'
p1833
aS'your dragon see huge explanation will have to put energy in every time it changes forms more when it goes small to big'
p1834
aS'okay basically you cant keep energy in a bottle you can keep something that will provide you energy'
p1835
aS'poor ava is probably flooded though'
p1836
aS'i dont mind subtweeting because i dont think we have many followers in common'
p1837
aS'which do you prefer'
p1838
aS'energy is the harder part of subatomic physics to understand i can either give you short answers or really long ones'
p1839
aS'so from the energy side energy isnt a thing its kind ofa state of being i guess'
p1840
aS'okay cool on to the second half of my explanation yes more sorry'
p1841
aS'aaaanyway your dragon transforms back and forth at will right'
p1842
aS'i personally like the idea of a radioactive dragon it would have a lead stomachlike pouch to avoid being poisoned d'
p1843
aS'so its a mix of physics and magic you want because you need the transforming part'
p1844
aS'because the only part of it that would lose mass is the plutonium'
p1845
aS'but the second option would result in your dragon losing mass secretly and irradiating everything around it'
p1846
aS'it cant be any more giant than 24 lbs of plutonium though because otherwise your dragon is a nuclear bomb'
p1847
aS'you can stick a giant lump of plutonium in your dragons belly'
p1848
aS'this is where you have two options you can either just say screw it and use magic or'
p1849
aS'but your dragon isnt going to be just one elementits going to be made up of water amp fatty acids amp protein chains amp'
p1850
aS'we dont have that capability on earth an old sci fi trope is cold fusion in which we somehow get around that problem'
p1851
aS'2 of 2 is heavy enough to literally fuse the atoms at the centre together'
p1852
aS'the sun runs on nuclear fusion but its because the sun is so huge that the weight of the gas further out 1 of 2'
p1853
aS'it takes more energy for us to fuse atoms together than the reaction produces'
p1854
aS'but irl even though weve succeeded at nuclear fusion its not a viable source of energy'
p1855
aS'okay one little sidenote things that are lighter than iron will give you more energy with nuclear fusion rather than fission'
p1856
aS'yep because carbon isotopes degrade so slowly theyre very predictable decayers'
p1857
aS'with me still'
p1858
aS'youd have to use a particle accelerator and one much stronger than the ones we currently have'
p1859
aS'in order to convert carbon you would have to fling it at itself so hard it splits we literally do not have the tech to do it'
p1860
aS'carbons atomic weight is relatively close to iron when compared with plutonium'
p1861
aS'its kind of a rule you learn in nuclear physics that all elements want to be iron its the most stable'
p1862
aS'you would get a lot of energy out but it wouldnt be as much energy as what you have to put in to split it'
p1863
aS'so basically in order for a dragon to shrink like that amp obey the laws of physics it would need energy'
p1864
aS'really really really slowly'
p1865
aS'there are radioactive isotopes of carbon but they are extremely hard to split they give off energy on their own anyway'
p1866
aS'other elements are radioactive because theyre unstable the number of neutrons is much higher than normal'
p1867
aS'some elements are so heavy that theyre radioactive just by virtue of being that element like uranium or plutonium'
p1868
aS'what we mean when we say an atom is radioactive is that its giving off energy in order to stabilise'
p1869
aS'but there are these atoms called isotopes that have more neutrons than normal usually this makes them less stable'
p1870
aS'the most stable kind of atom has a certain number of neutrons differing depending on the element'
p1871
aS'there are two possible particles in a nucleus protons and neutrons the number of protons determines what element it is'
p1872
aS'we need to back up a little bit so i can explain isotopes'
p1873
aS'okay so carbons atomic weight is about 12 the most efficient atom to use for energy has an atomic weight of about 239'
p1874
aS'with me so far'
p1875
aS'in your dragons case if life in your world is anything like ours hes a carbonbased life form'
p1876
aS'they also produce the most energy that way'
p1877
aS'so irl applications of nuclear fission use atoms with a really high atomic weight so that its easy to split them'
p1878
aS'but when you split atoms its not like theyre entirely converted because atoms break in specific ways'
p1879
aS'when people split atoms irl its usually to produce energy either for electricity or to explode stuff'
p1880
aS'so the relative weight of atoms atomic weight is calculated by knowing how many particles are in the nucleus amp what kind'
p1881
aS'relatively speaking the orbity things the electrons weigh a teeny tiny fraction of a single particle in the nucleus'
p1882
aS'a very simplified model of the atom the rutherford model is what most people are familiar with a nucleus amp orbity things'
p1883
aS'my explanation is going to be long and i might be sent to twitter jail'
p1884
aS'because irl the kind of atoms that can be split and partly converted to energy are very heavy'
p1885
aS'basically no matter what youre going to have to mix physics and magic here'
p1886
aS'okay i can absolutely answer this one'
p1887
aS'loving these pitchslam entries wed like to love even more of you mg thru a contemp thriller horror bring it'
p1888
aS'oh dude the weird things i googledont worry ask'
p1889
aS'also its conservation of massenergy because they can be converted'
p1890
aS'ill try'
p1891
aS'especially if like said it smells ofcontains strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner'
p1892
aS'if it smelled like mouldering forest litter and if it were made with exotic plants instead yes i collect perfumes'

aS'even just sitting around shooting the shitand um watching me make sparkly lisa frank tattoos'
p1894

p1895
aS'i wish i wish i could show you pictures but he likes being completely anon'
p1896
aS'anytime around then would be greatexcept for the 18th because ill be busy all day'
p1897
aS'i swear ill go back to writing in a second but has new glasses and its adorable'

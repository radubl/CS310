p55
aS'thanks liz most kind ff howre you'
p56
aS'thanks marc howre you ff'
p57
aS'hurrah for an exciting email '
p58
aS'afraid its bed time now busy day tomorrowsorry interesting discussion though'
p59
aS'you also study laws that werent proven and why same in say history of medicine'
p60
aS'both discount huge chunks of very important musical history'
p61
aS'by saying that music older than the c20th should no longer be performed thats just as bad as music ends in 1906'
p62
aS'and if youre convinced it begins with 2021st c and all else should be discounted then youre just the same in a diff way'
p63
aS'i dont think most people think music ends at any point more that its a continuous flow through human nature'
p64
aS'those should both read great historical aristotle plato etc'
p65
aS'great philosophers are important to modern philosophy just as great composers are important to modern music'
p66
aS'so youd commission music to be performed once may be wrongbut suspect funders would find that unsustainableundesirable'
p67
aS'you might as well say that each piece is old once its been played once and should never be reperformed'
p68
aS'it wouldnt be right if they did its like not learning about history or why things work'
p69
aS'i think more shocking is the concept of people not understanding where their music came from which would be augmented'
p70
aS'music ends  wherever would that idea come from'
p71
aS'but youre suggesting it should never be performed by saying cd exists youre suggesting cd is as good as live music'
p72
aS'so youd effectively get rid of all the music that has ever come before'
p73
aS'so youre suggesting every musician and ensemble in the country should just play 20th century music all the time'
p74
aS'yes it was lovely thank you another lovely day today with a workshop far too many ideas now'
p75
aS'not necessarily there is good music that isnt 20th century music too you know '
p76
aS'and this is often the case when you have an ensemblefunding to maintain'
p77
aS'true so you have to strike a middle ground if moneys what youre after'
p78
aS'thanks for retweeting the blog post ally  howre you'
p79
aS'i agree with this in principle and its fine if youre on your own and dont care about money '
p80
aS'thanks hannah  it was lovely to finally meet you'
p81
aS'lovely to see you too richard'
p82
aS'or if youre not bothered about audiences at all that performance would always have done well'
p83
aS'i think that depends when you have a big enough audience to not have to worry maybe'
p84
aS'i saw this earlier  thought it was very interesting perfect piece for this kind of audience'
p85
aS'ahh hate it when that happens '
p86

p438
aS'that before i think there are many forms of outreach that can all be effective if targeted and executed right'
p439
aS'wrong artists participating in the wrong venue which can have similar negative consequences ive experienced'
p440
aS'but similarly there could be a concert like you were involved in yesterday not publicised right with the'
p441
aS'good ones ive attended have said bring an instrument perc welcome or sing instruments often safer '
p442
aS'yes totally agree  people need to know what theyre letting themselves in for'
p443
aS'just personal preferences '
p444
aS'singing workshops are good outreach too all depends on the individuals involved there are no wrongs or rights'

p652
aS'im hoping thats what the choir think'

p654
aS'working on a gooey climactic point in the choir piece right now its not sounding magical enough yet though'

p705
aS'definitely i have lots of lovely crossrhythm and multiple time signature plans but spending time on the basics first'
p706
aS'so im testing them in a multitude of ways to check they feel natural and right if so they can stay'
p707
aS'i love it too this is for an a cappella choir though  have to ensure its singable so the rhythms must work fabulously'
p708
aS'yet another sketch which seems to alternate between time signatures 54 and 64 this time'

aS'oh no sick here too sending lots of sympathy your way'
p830
aS'definitely besides it would be boring if all our opinionstastes were the same'
p831
aS'so youre saying that in your opinion no tonal music can be new music'
p832
aS'i dont like it either im a bit anti labels to be honest a view shared by many im finding'
p833
aS'indeed'
p834
aS'a place for everything music for everyone the challenge is getting everyone to hear more'
p835
aS'oddly its a bit like religion all can have preferences but that doesnt make any wrong'
p836
aS'any music written now is new music tonal atonal bitonal ec you need to change your terminology '
p837
aS'why do you think i have anything against so called difficult music which is a silly concept to start with'
p838
aS'ill today annoying to miss out on everything we had planned on the plus side isabelle is looking after me very well'
p839
aS'eek hope one came eventually'
p840

p847
aS'how would you do that  demand soundcloud accounts contemporary music quiz improv test '
p848
aS'but theres already discussions about similar kinds of events occurring in the future '
p849
aS'for cnm i mean obviously limited by ensemble if you dont offer them that it wont be their nmd'
p850
aS'nothing wrong with that but for a nmd you need to also let members have an opporunity to present what they want'
p851
aS'ah i read it as attendees'
p852
aS'or attendees sorry threehourssleep'
p853
aS'as i said im not saying you run a workshop in each  im saying that you cant vet attendants by their music'
p854
aS'im not saying you dont have a focus im saying banning people who write tonal classical music is daft'
p855
aS'doesnt mean you have to aim it at them but silly to say that kind of music is excludedbanned'
p856
aS'stupid to deliberately exclude them though accessible and available to all is the way forward'
p857
aS'oh not suggesting restricting but the immediate area for cnm needs to be much wider than just colch definitely'
p858
aS'no thats not wise needs to be inclusive or youre just as bad as them '
p859
aS'will need to have a live bit too maybe a writing workshop wensemble early composing time workshop those later'
p860
aS'well it definitely needs to be more east anglia than just colchester keynote speaker sounds like a plan too'
p861
aS'admin from bed sounds fab sickness bug sadly  very poorly girlie yesterday while visiting friends eek'
p862
aS'would also need tweaking to include an ensemble for a nmd which would easily be possible'
p863

p864
aS'pingbacks are normally spiders or robots not blogs havent seen any blogs yet have been keeping an eye out'

p1207
aS'it wasnt short  was below knee length i dont do short skirts will stick to really long ones in the future'

aS'i agree'
p1243
aS'congratulations  cant wait to seehear d'
p1244
aS'i think sometimes pieces are played through by an ensemble and looked at by a panel which might justify both'
p1245
aS'ccubed i think making performances accessible and affordable is key for all of us  to help our music reach new audiences'
p1246
aS'have been bouncing isabelle with one arm during the recording session think i may now have one super muscley arm and one scrawny one'
p1247
aS'karis angels  thanks for all your hard work today sorry it was so mad and stressful and that i didnt thank you all properly thank you'

p1249
aS'ahh thats a great idea thats precisely what i need to set up'
p1250
aS'sounds like a plan i may invest in local external at some point but the nas seemed most sensible at the time'
p1251
aS'ok not sure if its 100 going to happen but it sounds like it might  no 3 from four black amp white pieces club in\xc3\xa9gales to\xe2\x80\xa6'
p1252
aS'indeed  new laptop arriving tomorrow or montues though so need to get a move on '
p1253
aS'i have external network attached storage its just finding the time to transfer everything across trying to now'
p1254
aS'spending a bit of time cleaning up my hdd need to reduce it to about a third of the size apparently i keep vast amounts of audio data'
p1255
aS'ooooh exciting'
p1256
aS'i agree one of my current pieces features buddhist style chanting  bar linestime sigs completely useless'
p1257
aS'morning just playing with catchy melody lines again today how is everyone'
p1258
aS'now its refreshed in my mind i think ill sleep on it and see which version seems more natural or a combination of both'
p1259
aS'i think i will do i originally wrote it a few months ago but knew the time sigs didnt feel right'
p1260
aS'im very torn between the two i think ill see how the piece develops mainly in terms of accompanying forces first'
p1261
aS'maybe thatll make it clear or maybe both will have a place at points within it time will tell i suppose'
p1262
aS'indeed at the moment its about equally easy either way may wait to decide until the piece has developed further'
p1263
aS'i agree i like doing that  it happens quite a lot at the moment often not intentionally'
p1264
aS'thats the problem  i think the three bar phrases could be more natural despite them being three bars in length'
p1265
aS'actually no  strangely for me just jolly with an 18 quaver length phrase '
p1266
aS'when i originally conceived of the melody last yr the 68 seemed more fun but returning to it think sensible may win'
p1267
aS'but not enough to sacrifice the playability of two bar phrases in 98 despite the fact that i like quirky phrase lengths'
p1268
aS'thats what my instinct is telling me i think i think i like the accents sightly more in 68'
p1269
aS'and the lines could fit in either with regard to strong beats not helpful'
p1270
aS'in a time signature quandry 68 and 98 could both work 98 would give 2 bar phrases more natural  68 quirky 3 bar ones that fitargh'
p1271
aS'im well thank you howre you ah file transfers are one of my tasks for later this evening moving to a new machine soon'
p1272
aS'have been working on two pieces with very catchy melodic lines tonight theyre currently battling it out for top earworm status'

p1281
aS'this coming from someone whose mother plays the piano too has perfect pitch and was able to identify all mistakes '
p1282
aS'maybe thatll be what she picks and why  i can see the appeal in learning something your parents dont know how to play'
p1283
aS'hope he tires out soon preferably before you want to head to bed'
p1284
aS'i think anyone could be swayed by harp such a beautiful instrument pain to cart around mind'

p1899
aS'still sad'

aS'an early night whats one of those  hope youre well and that your course was useful'

p1912
aS'or instrument in its own right even or both really i suppose'
p1913
aS'its strange because its such an amazing tool'
p1914
aS'stuck in that limbo when you have some fabulous proposal ideas an opportunity arises to use them but you appear to have no time'
p1915
aS'of course you should i think lots of people dont realise how diverse the application of electronics can be'
p1916
aS'personalisable possibly not the best english there customisable maybe '
p1917
aS'precisely which is what makes it so personalisable and such a wonderful tool  even if others cant see that'
p1918
aS'so of course you have the range of the instrument and the augmented almost unlimited range of extra things you can do'
p1919
aS'im being daft tired  forgetting that of course youre adding electronics not working just with the original instrument'
p1920
aS'interesting must be a challenge to produce music channeling that kind of thing using instruments of limited pitches'
p1921
aS'oooh now that would be interesting sadly the one i play regularly is equally tempered'
p1922

aS'very very good point thank you i think ive been won over by the newsletter'

aS'all very good points my one concern are the non social media types'
p2561
aS'very true  thank you for your wise words think i was unsure but swaying towards putting wheels in motion'
p2562
aS'i think id do that  especially for those i know who are always askingenquiring'
p2563
aS'this is precisely why im considering it  and for people i know who arent on social media who always ask what im up to'
p2564
aS'definitely not the busy and in demand thing i dont want to be forcing info out to peope but im aware some people do want to know'
p2565
aS'maintain communication flag up updates that may have happened to those who are interested without naggingboastingpushing'
p2566
aS'oh definitely ive always relied on twitter in the past but realise that there may be people whod like a newsletter'
p2567
aS'and i suppose on there it can easily be unlikedhiddenglossed over  potentially less annoying than an unwanted email'
p2568
aS'realise theres a huge number of people who dont use it maybe people are more likely to seeread info on facebook'
p2569
aS'ive toyed with the idea of a facebook page too but have decided against it in the past i much prefer twitter though i'
p2570
aS'sounds like a wise idea thank you for your thoughts definitely wouldnt want to send too many and spam people '
p2571
aS'or are newsletters from creatives yet another email that gets dusty at the bottom of an inbox'
p2572
aS'oops to clarify that last point i dont send out newsletters at all at the moment should i be doing so and add it to the site'

p2689
aS'well precisely im sure it will im sure ill engage with it more when i have more time  ie when iz is at school '
p2690
aS'sticking keys on my clavinova are making it hard to input into sibelius easily roll on getting a new electric piano in a couple of months'
p2691

p2701
aS'oooh that sounds exciting but not as exciting as saturday d d'
p2702
aS'aww'
p2703
aS'it purely from a more egotistical point of view whereas some are merely sharing their mood'
p2704
aS'and your thoughts on said tweeter i dont think its a tweeting class issue but i do think some people do'
p2705
aS'i think its tricky with regard to exciting news to share soon tweets maybe it depends on who sends them'
p2706
aS'i too have people on my feed who share the same links umpteen times of a morning rather annoying'
p2707
aS'not spam at all a vert interesting conversation i was teaching hence not participating '
p2708
aS'indeed im sure therell still be many that do it and drive those of us who are very nosy mad'
p2709
aS'i agree with the attention seeking bit i have been guilty of doing it in the past too but trying to get out of the habit'
p2710
aS'a little cruel isnt it im trying to stop doing that whenever anything excitings happening'
p2711
aS'blimey'
p2712
aS'morning feeling a bit sluggish today looking forward to feeding my soul with some good music to perk it up'

p2715
aS'thanks  alerted me to it hes trying to sort it he doesnt seem to have much luck'
p2716
aS'oh i missed that i think  was it a small groupinstitution or someone well known '
p2717
aS'in fact ive just realised that one ive applied for didnt send out anything and should have by now so annoying'
p2718
aS'oh no what was that one  especially rubbish when they dont send anything at all too'
p2719
aS'and they let you know early impressive which reminds me  i have one of those coming up must find the date argh'
p2720
aS'i do similar  i write down the deadlines as a week or so earlier usually '
p2721
aS'it was which makes me wonder if i should spend so much time over similar things in the future'
p2722
aS'i need to do the same just got a new laptop though and havent got the calendar synching with phone yet '
p2723
aS'hehe  i find thats the best way forgetting that way if its good news its a surprise and if its bad doesnt matter'
p2724
aS'managed to forget about the last one i did and was hurrying the application a couple of hours beforehand with an ill iz'
p2725
aS'would definitely help im sure i wouldnt apply for anything without mine not that i hit many deadlines at the moment '
p2726

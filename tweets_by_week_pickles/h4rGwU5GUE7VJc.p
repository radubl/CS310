aS'it would be too much the bond is 1195 stupid gov taking there time with everything '
p293
aS'well the only things stopping us from being homeless now is dhs could be in there today if they did it'
p294
aS'so once again its the vic gov screwing uswe have no idea how we are going to get by until then we thought maybe it would be tomorrow '
p295

p301
aS'the bond loan approval can take up to 3 days hopefully it doesnt if we explain that we are currently homeless fingers crossed'
p302
aS'we might be approved for a place we applied for yesterday the agent knows our situation and seems willing to give us a chance'
p303
aS'not sure where we need to go today to get help with somewhere to sleep tonight and over the weekend'
p304
aS'we were doing fine until his accident and now our lives are a mess we have been used as a political football with no help from either side'
p305
aS'joe is sick to at the moment hoping he is just run down but still it doesnt help things right now'
p306
aS'cant sleep  have somewhere to sleep though luckily out of cash for upcoming weekend accommodation though which is terrifying me'
p307
aS'we had to take some time off twitter joe got an email from dse saying the wont be rehiring him months after they sacked him mindgames'
p308

p316
aS'twitter is one of the few places where ppl are equal we all get 140 characters regardless of fame '
p317
aS'we hope so too its not a script it our real thoughts feelings and reactions at certain times to certain things'
p318
aS'we were asked to do this to raise awareness to share the good and the bad some people just dont get it'
p319
aS'exactley but some feel the need to still feel powerful over others or enforce there opinion '
p320
aS'just wanted to remind people that it is our choice who we block or speak to just like anyone elses homeless doesnt mean no dignity'
p321
aS'you to sue sleep well '
p322
aS'this account is designed to explain feelings emotions and experiences on the streetnot about you bye'
p323
aS'you clearly do not know the whole story i sure there is something you can be doing better than hassling us'
p324
aS'who do you think you are to judge us and then expect us to be kind to you for doing so'
p325
aS'coming from a person with 152k tweets and less followers your opinion and judgements are not required'

p332
aS'we just want to say thank you to all the charitys and serviceswe have had a couple of tired workers but overall its amazing what you do'
p333
aS'i cant imagine how distressing it must be for the staff of services at times restricted with budgets limiting how much they can help'
p334
aS'us too will do and you do the same '
p335
aS'you already have been with us  i can definitely see you would be good at it'
p336
aS'totally a juggle but the struggles are what gives us strength of character and the want for better things for everyone'
p337
aS'thank you will keep that in mind if i need bail haha joking obviously but thanks mate'
p338
aS'accommodation is clean warm and safe all we can hope for '

p342

p344
aS'ben is having a rest and making a coffee so im tweetingggg '
p345
aS'i offered the lady to use my phone but she just looked down at the ground and said no thanks and left  still bothering me joe'
p346
aS'agreedmaybe one day in the future its definitely something i am considering '
p347
aS'well i plan on turning the bad into a new even stronger me now i some how feel i needed a wake up but not this much lol'

p351
aS'i agree with all except for the brave amp wise i just cant stand human suffering no one should ever have to in this world'
p352
aS'everyone deserves care be they sick old homeless disabled or abled you are a brave amp wise '
p353
aS'i got into firefighting because i love helping people new calling and career on the horizon maybe giving it back to ben now p'
p354
aS'its joe when i was a firefighter i seen and dealt with some horrific situations never did i forget people were victims and deserved care'
p355
aS'we will now thankfully hope you get a good rest also and thanks for the email earlier it did help '
p356
aS'its horrible i think we have found a new calling once on our feet we want to contribute to helping someway'
p357
aS'it seems to me that some not all of these service workers in fact dont have an ounce of compassion for people'
p358
aS'we went back and he had good news he found a place heading there now feeling so grateful and relieved'
p359
aS'thanks never experienced anything like this very confronting and awful feeling '
p360
aS'told us he would see what else he can do but he didnt look confident '
p361
aS'so we just went back in and the guy told us they might not be able to help cant find anywhere said maybe we could sleep in the car'
p362
aS'no they are staff '
p363
aS'yeah we do '
p364
aS'we will def following it up with her manager we are both still stunned how bad she was'
p365
aS'ok so we just got seen by another guy who was also really nice he said to come back in 20 mins whilst he works out where to send us tonight'
p366
aS'will do '
p367
aS'aww nooo we will be ok tonight thanks for offering '
p368
aS'i work in mental and crisis care its amazing the amount of people that do that really shouldnt'
p369
aS'also when we rang earlier she told us we had to come in to get helpno exceptions then she does it for someone else in front of us '
p370
aS'she is clearly having a power trip with the homeless on the other hand the other guy that works here is the opposite seems really nice'
p371
aS'nope  the same cow that gave us wrong info about food van is the one i am talking about'
p372
aS'thats what i thought to we are both so angry and its not even about us how dare she speak to people like this'
p373
aS'yeah but then maybe we wont get help is what worries me'
p374
aS'she told a girl with an intellectual disability togo awaythe girl asked for medical help and she saidthere is nothing wrong with you'
p375
aS'she has literally acted like a cow to everyone who approached the counter if she hates her job so much why work here'
p376
aS'we are actually going to make a complaint about her behavior and attitude tomorrow and she hasnt even spoken to us she should not be here'
p377
aS'trish has spent her time laughing with colleagues and twiddling her thumbs all whilst telling people calling in that they are very busy '
p378
aS'an elderly lady came in and asked to make a call trish snapped no we are really busy come back in an hour the elderly woman left'
p379
aS'she is so horrible rude mean and dismissive to everyone who had come in so farshe has sat behind a desk saying how busy she is to everyone'
p380
aS'a worker called trish is to date far worse than anyone we have come across and we havent dealt with her yet'
p381
aS'so we are still waiting at st kilda crisis service and not looking forward to experiencing what others have in front of us'
p382
aS'from experience ben mental health is probably the lowest level of support id be long dead if not for family '
p383
aS'definitely'
p384
aS'once again money talks it can get u anything have none you get nothing'
p385
aS'we had no idea things were so bad before this'
p386
aS'mental health seems the lowest priority its a vicious cycle i feel sorry for the people worse off than us its a hopeless feeling'
p387
aS'its disgusting for everyone involved drug addicts not getting proper treatment services underfunded staff stressed out the list goes on'
p388
aS'thanks will keep in mind in future'
p389
aS'we have decided maybe the detention centers could do a swap asylum seekers out of detention centers amp long term drug abusers in'
p390
aS'i try not to think like that even though its true people earnt or received there own money one way or another still sad'
p391
aS'very '
p392
aS'lol we wont starve just disappointing she sent us somewhere only to find that it is either gone or something else happened'
p393
aS'well i guess we dont now it would seem'
p394
aS'with a full waiting room at the st kilda crisis centre we appeared to be the only ones not on drugs and or alcohol'
p395
aS'we walked to where she said the food van would be and nothing there at all parking cost 2 for 30 mins got 2 left now 22'
p396
aS'so we made it to the crisis centre the woman said there is a long list ahead of us told us where we could go to get a meal 12'
p397
aS'contacted them secret squirrel style lol they have been an amazing help for us '
p398
aS'awesome thanks for the tip and offer will let you know '
p399
aS'they are open until 11pm tonight from memory when do you reckon things will be a little quieter to get in'
p400
aS'greens mp already struggling after 2days of living on the dole'
p401
aS'thanks so much for the offer but we are going to try after peak hour not keen on leaving car alone its all we have atm lol'
p402
aS'thanks anyway '
p403
aS'both with anz now we should be able to do it after rush hour hopefully guess we will find out i have racv i guess lol'
p404
aS'what time do you think it will be a little quieter to drive in'
p405
aS'we are going to try and drive to st kilda after rush hour not sure about the fuel never had it this low before'
p406
aS'home ground require you to attend at 830 in the morning and line upfirst come first serveunable to help outside those hours'
p407
aS'st kilda crisis centre can put us up for the night if we walk there from chadstone apparently no money or fuel to get there awesome'
p408
aS'so now we have no where to sleep tonight again another wasted day with services unable to help'
p409
aS'we might be getting some help from  calling back in an hour fingers crossed '
p410
aS'your understanding so far has been great it makes a difference to us  dont be sorry nothing you can do'
p411
aS'joe is on hold with centrelink 30 mins so far'
p412
aS'that seems to be working against us not considered needing help'
p413
aS'not wash our clothes or take care of personal hygiene'
p414
aS'buy some alcohol and get drunk then go in and abuse people help then'
p415
aS'maybe if we take drugs wed get help seems to be working for others we have seen in the services'
p416
aS'the silly thing is it would cost more in the long run to keep wasting money on hotelmotels for the night'
p417
aS'but now we are stuck again will have to cancel the appointment and go back to the housing services again'
p418
aS'we did that this morning the answer was no the girl was a really nice girl and she is the one who got us a place'
p419
aS'well so far we have been told we dont look or act homeless so possibly that other than that the fact we are gay seems an issue'
p420
aS'we dont know they just offer a motel for a night or two and wish us luck thats it so far'
p421
aS'we just did that'
p422
aS'we have been told of the help others have received in our situation so what is the differenceno case manager for us why'
p423
aS'i dont know really seems fair really to want the money we feel more discriminated against by the housing services in melb'
p424
aS'spoke to the estate agent just now they need payment in full before we could move in no other options '
p425
aS'thanks for the info but thats all been sorted already its the rent in advance that is the issue'
p426
aS'thats what the estate agent sent us any ideas how other people achieve this'
p427
aS'per calendar month  275 per week is actually 119500 per month it accounts for every day in the year 2757 x 36512  119500'
p428
aS'err so weve found a place we can get for 275 a week can come up with the bond but cant get 1 months rent up front same problem again'
p429
aS'the lady at the motel when we left said she doesnt understand why the services are not helping us find a place like the '

p436

p437
aS'he has tried so hard to cope with basically nothing but negatives and little to no support after the accident i have tried my best to help'
p438
aS'we have been together for 5 years now we had a normal life together before his accident and then everything went to hell'
p439
aS'since joe had the accident i worry about him a lot he isnt the same as he use to be he loved helping people and now he just seems broken'
p440
aS'sick of trying to figure out peoples ulterior motives '
p441
aS'i am angry and i know i need to let it go but i dont know how while everything is still a consequence of the accident  '
p442

p456
aS'if ted baillieus anything to go by the government plans to leave the state bludgeoned and sobbing'
p457
aS'i know right you need a job to get a house and a house to get job it plays a bit like a bad joke'
p458
aS'theyll probably get converted in to government funded crack houses used for the express purposes of a familyrun brothel'
p459
aS'yeah i was surprised at quickly everything declined i can definitely feel it in my body'
p460
aS'i cant fault a lot of the services in that you generally can see people want to help bureaucratic door stops in place'
p461
aS'thanks we have no choice but to handle it all joe did was get hurt firefighting and well be damned if thatll stop us'
p462
aS'yeah it annoys me too apparently if you go to enough effort to make yourself a blight on society youll get a hand out'
p463
aS'haha well as much as id like to be a manager i get the impression my resume would be met with a cocked brow'
p464
aS'we have been some end up with this strange smell lol'
p465
aS'its more about how the moneys spent it seems to be a selfperpetuating loop where the only options onenight accommodation'
p466
aS'lol thats actually a pretty good idea although at this point i might have to make an improv version with a bucket and stick'
p467
aS'persistence is key with all this but its hard to persist when youre generally rundown and lacking direction'
p468
aS'yeah it seems that a lot of the services are only equipped with enough to offer small mercies'
p469
aS'apparently ive taken a washing machine for granted trying to wash your clothes without ones a bitch'
p470
aS'ill trade places with you and see just how grateful you are for it'
p471
aS'id like to see anyone be grateful for a miserable situation they were thrust in to at no request of their own'

p949
aS'we were also told the best chance we have is too look on and see if there is any private rentals as it is faster'
p950
aS'i should also mention i called the gayamplesbian switchboard helpline whilst in the car they could offer no help or ideas at all'
p951
aS'i could see the girl was doing her best for us with what little funds they have to disperse and thanked her and told her  your a lifesaver'
p952
aS'she also suggested we attend in the morning at 830 am but also warned they may not be able to do a lot either'
p953
aS'when we returned she had some good news she managed to get us a motel room for the night but stressed it would be tonight only'
p954
aS'she said she would see what else she could arrange and asked us to come back in 30 mins we went and waited in the car'
p955
aS'whilst it was disappointing to hear i really felt comforted with her honesty and she was a really nice girl to talk too'
p956
aS'or drug and or alcohol issues and that it may not be the best place for us to stay or be the safest either for a male couple 12'
p957
aS'she informed us that the best we are likely to get would be a rooming house and that a lot of the people there have mental health 12'
p958
aS'she gave us a bleak outlook but i could tell she wasnt happy saying it to us as i think she wanted to do more but cant'
p959
aS'after waiting about 10 minutes a worker called us into a room and asked us to explain the circumstances etc'
p960
aS'there was also a woman with 2 children who all looked well dressed and clean but clearly stressed we were told to sit and wait to be seen'
p961
aS'there was a woman in the foyer who was ranting at anyone who looked in her direction which was totally incoherent we both felt bad for her'
p962
aS'ok moving on so we decided to just front up at st kilda crisis service which was very confronting for us both due to the people we seen'
p963
aS'thanks will do '
p964
aS'i still had the right to block him and instead he works his way around it to still say things  harassment'
p965
aS'i came on here to share my story and hope it may help others after me not to be ridiculed by people who clearly just want attention'
p966
aS'i do not deserve to be spoken down to by a child and i will call him that since he acts like that pretty sure he wouldnt say it to my face'
p967
aS'i was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after the accident and i am trying to keep myself together'
p968
aS'i have fought major bushfires and rescued countless people both in the cfa and parks victoria and i am expected to cope shit from a kid'
p969
aS'instead of leaving me alone after i blocked him he gets people to retweet things too me all whilst they pick on every spelling mistake'
p970
aS'his friends blindly back him and tell others he had never spammed me he spams twitter every day with garbage'
p971
aS'i blocked him a long time ago on my own account as i seen he just tweets all day and night 118k i believe obviously a deep person'
p972

p1012
aS'suggested we call though feeling pretty down at the moment will call'
p1013
aS'he told us we should go back to where we came from as it would be better there and was stuck on previous issues rather then helping'
p1014
aS'contacted st kilda crisis centre and was met with an extremely rude and unhelpful man on the other end was told it was to late to call'
p1015
aS'if you know of any orgscharities able to help w finding emergency accommodation for pls get in contact '

p1025
aS'ive withheld the fact im gay publicly out of the fear it may affect peoples view or willingness to help now i dont care'
p1026
aS'during my recovery while no one else was there the cats were theyve become like our kids and we wont abandon them for anyone'
p1027
aS'we fear that owning cats and being gay has led to a certain amount of prejudice'
p1028
aS'the cats are well fed and well looked after to a certain degree we put them before ourselves theyre currently asleep'
p1029
aS'were a gay couple with two cats weve been rejected on the basis we own cats and told to take them to the rspca'

aS'i wonder if ted bailieu realises the twisted irony in stating he cares about firefighters ive been dumped and left to rot springst'
p1031
aS'were good people all we want is stability back in our lives never take for granted having a home and job'
p1032
aS'weve repeatedly had our hygiene morals and character questioned for no other reason than that we are homeless'
p1033
aS'the stigma surrounding homelessness is unfair and unjust most people conclude that to be homeless is to be filthy and drugaddled'
p1034
aS'through all of this the worst of what weve experienced is the mental and emotional toll it has taken on us'
p1035
aS'this is a link for cadarg luke'
p1036
aS'while im tweeting this we are heading to melbourne unsure of where were sleeping for another night weve just reached geelonh'
p1037
aS'after another sleepless night we went to ozchild to receive the fuel vouchers the woman we spoke to was very understanding'
p1038
aS'the guy wed spoken to from vinnies by luck recontacted us to ask how we were going we explained and he put us up in another motel'
p1039
aS'at this point wed left bethany fearful we may be on the street for the night we went to a quiet place to consider our options'
p1040
aS'when we returned to bethany whilst shed tried there was nothing she could do other than refer us to ozchild for fuel andor food vouchers'
p1041
aS'while we were in centrelink for 4 hours she contacted a number of places about accommodation but to no avail'
p1042
aS'we found a service called bethany who offered a range of services the woman we spoke to was great and advised us to go to centrelink'
p1043
aS'in the morning after a restless night we headed to warrnambol to see if any of the services could help unsure of where we would sleep'
p1044
aS'he put us up in a motel for the night and gave us money for food he later told us his son had himself died in a workplace accident 22'
p1045
aS'we called vinnies and the guy that answered the phone seemed like a jerk this was a misjudgment on our part 12'
p1046
aS'as of friday 11012013 we were evicted prior to this wed had no issues paying rent and now were forced to live in our car'
p1047
aS'but due to delayed or a complete lack of response it was all to late 22'
p1048
aS'we rang all the local services and were told to seek private rental offering no assistance we contacted real estate agents 12'
p1049
aS'and lack of verbal notification from our landlord we only had a week to exit the property 22'
p1050
aS'at this point our landlord sent an eviction notice and by the time we received it due to the post office 12'
p1051
aS'during this time we sold anything we owned of value to cash converters to buy food and fuel money quickly ran out as a consequence'
p1052
aS'as for cgu they wouldnt speak to me directly and had provided no seperation certificate or any proof that i was off payments'
p1053
aS'centrelink refused to tell us how long this would take and said that in the meantime we werent entitled to any assistance'
p1054
aS'due to the accident i had to prove i wasnt receiving payments or had a lump sum payment from cgu insurance stopped by bureaucracy22'
p1055
aS'we went to centrelink in bendigo and told them wed be homeless we were told we couldnt receive help or payments because of paperwork12'
p1056
aS'cadarg was useless they were disinterested and appeared to know nothing about housing rentals or other services and offered nothing'
p1057
aS'we first approached a service called cadarg intended as a program to prevent homelessness and to resituate you should prevention fail'
p1058
aS'our rent was in arrears so we decided we needed to go to services for help as it became apparent the state government wasnt going to'
p1059
aS'the state government for months alluded i would be reemployed they just needed to process my paperwork this was a lie'
p1060
aS'i tried to avoid going on centrelink in the hope that we could recover our finances'

S'you have serious problems with your moral compass'
p17
aS'but if you read that article and get guns are bad instead of shes gonna live and he got caught will be tried'
p18
aS'not all criminals think things through especially if mentally unstable as i believe hell turn out to be'
p19
aS'given that i think like a soldier a knife would have been the better tool for that scenario by far but'
p20
aS'because he decided that was the way to go who knows why pple do one thing instead of something else'
p21
aS'seems the gun isnt the problem now is it'
p22
aS'didnt say violent crime i said violence and violent crime is dropping as gun ownership is rising hmmm'
p23
aS'yeah like chicago where they really restrict access to the law abiding right'
p24
aS'her supporters really are making this too easy its almost no fun swatting them with true facts  almost'
p25
aS'you just want to ban the device you are obviously to stupid to be trusted with'
p26
aS'the fact that you believe its the gun thats the problem tells me you dont care about the problem'
p27
aS'and i dont blame the tool used for violence i blame the person committing the violent act'
p28
aS'in violence in general instead your so scared of some inanimate object instead of learning you want a ban'
p29
aS'and you are soo caught up in demonizing an inanimate object you fail to see the real problem is a rise'
p30
aS'is the guy mentally unstable yeah probably and the article also said nothing about it being an illegal gun'
p31
aS'that make them gun fanatics and sorry but you cant lose iq points you never had in the first place'
p32
aS'and my kids have pics with their single shot 22s at the range where i teach them real gun safety'
p33
aS'if your going to quote someone at least get that right since yall cant get facts straight at least do that'
p34
aS'first off he isnt necessarily a gun extremist second i mentioned he probably got a bgc when he bought it'
p35
aS'my whole family agrees with you 100'
p36
aS'shes a moron just listen to the lies she spews every time she opens her mouth'
p37
aS'hides behind armed guards one of my favorites gunsense momsdemand everytown 2a tcot pjnet tlot'
p38
aS'hamas goes to that first so now they must deal with the consequences of that decision'
p39
aS'attacked not just the one responsible a different leader may choose different actions but instead of terrorism as a last resort'
p40
aS'didnt say that if true he should be tried and convicted but the whole country is not to blame as a whole and thats who is being'
p41
aS'dont know but does it matter now if true hamas is still guilty more so than israel  as their issue is with one guy not the cntry'
p42
aS'which would have made more sense an assassination instead of terrorism makes more sense'
p43
aS'did they even attempt it no they just indiscriminately attacked civilians instead of a surgical strike against one guy'
p44
aS'to devolve into what we have today'
p45
aS'and yet hamas did not seek to have charges leveled in world court but simply committed their own atrocities forcing the issue'
p46
aS'situation still stands true israel has a right to defend themselves from the hamas terrorists'
p47
aS'if this is true he should be replaced as a world leader and doesnt deserve the post but my original opinion of the gaza '
p48
aS'i research to form my opinions and my opinion changes as i get better informed about any subject'
p49
aS'not necessarily but like i said i know nothing about they guy and so have no opinion of him at this time'
p50
aS'and we have a memorial for the victims of the 911 attacks in ny here in the states'
p51
aS'and your claim about him is ill get back to you later on him after i have a chance to check into him as a person and whatnot'
p52
aS'i cant give an opinion on things i know nothing about just not something i do and i would need to do more research to do so'
p53
aS'dont know the guy honestly barely pay attention to who runs what these days doesnt he run jordan or something not sure'
p54
aS'im always up for a good debate its the disagreements that built this great country'
p55
aS'in my opinion yes'
p56
aS'wow lie much fed law does cover this subject already educate yourself on what you advocate already geez'
p57
aS'educate yourself on the subject before you make yourself look stupid'
p58
aS'such as target shooting marksmanship training competition lots of different uses that have nothing to do with killing'
p59
aS'wrong again there is no sole purpose of a gun its purpose is what the owner intends to use it for'
p60
aS'just one of many reasons she cant win in texas we dont have any bcg loopholes idiot'
p61
aS'gun skills for kids are just as important as any other subject and should be taught in schools'
p62
aS'must have been one of yall that posted that most gun owners i know would never admit to having that big of grouping'
p63
aS'awwe i still got 7 hrs at work to kill lol'
p64
aS'hell there are legal explosives anyone over 18 can buy called tannerite used in explosive targets'
p65
aS'nope not toys fun but no absolutely not a toy'
p66
aS'and in south dakota its a state permit not federal so for explosives and destructive devices every state is different regs'
p67
aS'none its just fun to go to the explosive range and blow stuff up at a distance of course'
p68
aS'im simply keeping the options open by keeping them current'
p69
aS'there are numerous jobs that use explosives you know'
p70
aS'allowed me to get such permits rather easily the high explosives permit allows me to work in that field if i so choose'
p71
aS'i have two different explosives permits myself one for 40mm grenades and one for high grade explosives military training'
p72
aS'and i hope they are caught and prosecuted if it is anything but self defense'
p73
aS'can only be fired in certain places and must be outside of city limits and that didnt take as long to get as a chl permit'
p74
aS'as a matter of fact i have my permits allowing me to own 40mm grenades for a 203 grenade launcher use is of course restricted'
p75
aS'and actually legal to own as well with proper explosives permits'
p76
aS'true but again other than age restrictions what regulation restricts its purchase'
p77
aS'if i recall that is a bio weapon and universally illegal everywhere in the world'
p78
aS'the bazooka as you call it is actually a rocket and not a firearm it is in fact an explosive device that can be aimed'
p79
aS'by the legal definition thats how'
p80
aS'example i have 3 firearms that are only intended as instructional tools for teaching my kids how to shoot at paper not kill'
p81
aS'regulated sure but not nearly as much as guns and a firearms intended use is what the owner decides it is'
p82
aS'and thats not propaganda i came to that conclusion long before i ever knew the nra existed when i was studying the constitution'
p83
aS'no actually most americans do not want more laws they want the current ones enforced'
p84
aS'some mysterious object to them its a tool with specific uses and not a toy'
p85
aS'but i will continue to educate them in proper use and handling of firearms my children do not have accidents because guns are not'
p86
aS'i have also taught my children what firearms are and their proper use well the basics so far they are still young'
p87
aS'well cars boats fuels alcohol cigarettescigars knives bowsarrows to name a few'
p88
aS'mag limits are even dumber than restrictions on cosmetic options for firearms'
p89
aS'actually in certain forms cyanide is legal to carry around ie rat poison'
p90
aS'wrong a bazooka is a destructive device not a firearm and so has no bearing on gun control issue try again'
p91
aS'rights to own firearms of course they could just use some other weapon but gun control pple are only concerned about the guns'
p92
aS'and technically speaking all gun control laws are illegal in the us but we accept certain restrictions such as removing felons'
p93
aS'my guns if misused can be very dangerous but throughout my life i have been educated in the proper use and handling of them'
p94
aS'well there are a lot of dangerous things out there not even half as regulated as guns we need education not restriction'
p95
aS'what is there to misinterpret its one sentence one with one meaning no infringement of the right to keep and bear arms'
p96
aS'never committed a violent crime in my life and even carry a firearm at work sidearm and shotgun so its not the gun its just him'
p97
aS'owning a gun does not make you a criminal in waiting i own several guns i have always owned a firearm since i was 6yrs old'
p98
aS'when in fact you cant do anything to prevent someone from buying a gun that has not yet committed a crime'
p99
aS'that takes care of him problem with gun control is that it assumes anyone buying a gun is a criminal and you must prove ur not'
p100
aS'ok then blame the guy and not the gun then he will be prosecuted and convicted and as a felon no longer allowed gun ownership'
p101
aS'if thats true why harp on the gun instead of the violence itself the guy committed the crime blame him not the gun'
p102
aS'that makes zero sense'
p103
aS'if im no threat to the general public owning or carrying a firearm why should i accept any restrictions on what type i own'
p104
aS'it is federal law already sheesh'
p105
aS'not what was used to carry it out'
p106
aS'and the difference being what just the tool used to accomplish the act what should be the focus is the violent act'
p107
aS'i would say you have a bigger problem with guns than with violent people which i say is crazy'
p108
aS'ask yourself this if he used a knife would it have made news at all your more concerned about the gun than the act'
p109
aS'nra propaganda oh your one of those that blame the gun instead of the person huh'
p110
aS'all of which is already covered with current gun laws next'
p111
aS'that guys actions were his the gun didnt make him do squat'
p112
aS'yes i did did you if the article is fact then the guy is guilty and will be punished accordingly the gun had nothing to do with'
p113
aS'dont restrict the rest of us and its not the guns fault it was the guy not the gun'
p114
aS'sure but come up with a solution that keeps the crazies and felons from getting them that also leaves us alone'
p115
aS'and im sure he bought that gun with a bgc meaning bcg fails again'
p116
aS'he may be a nut but that doesnt make him a gun extremist'
p117
aS'everyone is capable of killing in the right circumstances'
p118
aS'seriously a facebook post makes him a gun extremist right ok your retarded i suppose you think all gun owners extremists'
p119
aS'that its just gunsense for gun owners to be registered we say criminals first tcot nj2as 2a'
p120
aS'how many liberals'
p121
aS'thats because most citizens vote against them so they have to resort to amnesty to illegals to get votes'
p122
aS''
p123
aS'rt if you agree that americans should be free to make their own health care choices not have them made by the governm\xe2\x80\xa6'
p124
aS'days at best no way its weeks'
p125
aS'after the decision today striking down another dc gun ban 2a supporters are celebrating gunsense'
p126
aS'ive been threatened with a beheading a bullet through my head and called every name in the book religion of peace tho\xe2\x80\xa6'
p127
aS'beheading threats of dragging my entrails through stuff i thought it was funny pissed them off more lol\xf0\x9f\x98\x80'
p128
aS'you too huh i should find the threat notes i got after i started tipping my bullets in bacon grease when i was deployed'
p129
aS'oh thats rich geez when are leftists gonna be forced to face facts their on the wrong side of nearly every issue'
p130
aS'exactly'
p131
aS'like the hamas attacking anyone is a terrorist attack as they are a terrorist organization'
p132
aS'any attack by a designated terrorist organization is a terrorist attack'
p133
aS'that sounds like a terrorist attack course you gave very very limited information about it'
p134
aS'message to my friends once they get started they wont stop i suggest you start giving a damn'
p135
aS'if the attack on the hotel was indiscriminate and made no attempt to limit the casualties to the specific target sure could be'
p136
aS'i would have to say probably not again depends on attempt to limit collateral damage and what the target is'
p137
aS'however there is an exception if say he were ordering military strikes on his own that makes him a legitimate target'
p138
aS'he is still merely a trumped up messenger an administrator following others orders a civilian'
p139
aS'also only a country can declare war not a criminal organization'
p140
aS'and last i checked paul bremer is an ambassador so that would not be a legitimate target'
p141
aS'if the attack is against say a military target personnel or equipment thats a legitimate war target and not terrorism'
p142
aS'if the targets a civilian gov office like post office the attackers are terrorist scum'
p143
aS'assuming also they know what their explosives will do that is true'
p144
aS'how long before it went off a minute an hour a day'
p145
aS'correct in my opinion assuming of course the intent was to take out the entire wing regardless of civilian casualties'
p146
aS'the ira have no regard for civilian casualties that males them terrorists'
p147
aS'the bomb takes out the entire hotel without regard to civilians in the area thats terrorism'
p148
aS'for example the bomb only takes out one or two rooms housing the military officials thats an assassination not terrorism'
p149
aS'not if the attack is religiously motivated alone andor doesnt take steps to limit collateral damage'
p150
aS'it seems to me you are attempting to justify terrorist attacks in some way'
p151
aS'interesting conversation this is'
p152
aS'and again was there an attempt at least to limit collateral damage'
p153
aS'depends military generals office or like a social security office type target one is the other isnt'
p154
aS'for example a generals office or a social security office'
p155
aS'depends random gov admin or military admin'
p156
aS'and the israeli gov is not a religious fanatic group of terrorists'
p157
aS'sorry i see where your going with this hamas is not a governing power'
p158
aS'if the attack is because of different religious beliefs yes terrorism'
p159
aS'and yes if religious fanatics bomb a random hotel for the purpose of civilian casualties as much as possible yes'
p160
aS'the attempt to limit collateral damage hamas makes no attempts to limit collateral damage israel does thats difference'
p161
aS'collateral damage happens in every war no avoiding it but the difference between military strike and terrorism is'
p162
aS'i also consider any attack based purely on religious beliefs terrorism as well'
p163
aS'if say 4 military 96 civilians on vacation and their was no attempt to limit the civilians death thats terrorism'
p164
aS'no if the hotel were used as a barracks the admin staff take the risk of working for the military like civi contractors'
p165
aS'depends what was the target and did they attempt to limit civilian casualties'
p166
aS'target'
p167
aS'if the israeli military were using the hotel completely as a barracks and not a vacation spot that would be military'
p168
aS'it a terrorist attack as well'
p169
aS'however the attack would have to be designed to limit as much as possible collateral damage not caring about that makes'
p170
aS'wow splitting hairs if they were there for a purely military reason that would be a military assassination in my mind'
p171
aS'but if any organization just randomly for no other reason but to kill random people bombs a hotel yes thats terrorism'
p172
aS'thus not a terrorist attack but a legitimate military attack on a military target with unfortunate collateral damage'
p173
aS'if the intended target is say hamas weapons store in a hotel that makes it a military target'
p174
aS'if the purpose is to intentionally kill random civilians yes'
p175
aS'you see the difference between a terrorist attack and unintended collateral damage is the purpose behind the attack'
p176
aS'if the intended target is to kill as many civilians as possible and not say a specific military assassination attempt yes'
p177
aS'or hung that would be better'
p178
aS'just the same as i would like to see obama put in prison for sympathizing with terrorists'
p179
aS'i question as to weather an organization is terrorist but once established as terrorists i support their destruction'
p180
aS'controlled countries or any religion controlling any country cause its always bad'
p181
aS'oh yeah and neither does the rest of the world as no country of palestine ever existed and no i dont support muslim'
p182
aS'really now whos drinking the koolaid israel never wanted palestinian state and still does not recognize gaza as one'
p183
aS'and i dont recognize any terrorist organization as a legitimate country leadership period'
p184
aS'got in the way of their civilian target so sorry but they get no sympathy from me hamas is a recognized terrorist org'
p185
aS'i might be more supportive but they not only attack unprovoked but also do not attack military targets unless it somehow'
p186
aS'jewish controlled israel gov and attempted to set up their own country if they had done it and not attacked israel'
p187
aS'oh please get a brain study history the whole thing started because muslim hamas refused to live peacefully with the'
p188
aS'excuse me i am american and we are not terrorists either we do not target innocent civilians thats hamas'
p189
aS'oceanfront property in arizona to sell ya'
p190
aS'yeah im sure the well kill you if dont vote for us crowd had a fair election right sure if you believe that i got some'
p191
aS'other countries land and constantly killing civilians on purpose they should have been wiped out years ago'
p192
aS'ahh so you support terrorists then hamas is not a gov gaza is not a country its a terrorist organization holding some'
p193
aS'long for them to finally act against hamas is the first place'
p194
aS'nope they are not the terrorists here and hamas attacked them not the other way around personally surprised it took so'
p195
aS'sorry i dont advocate or actually kill innocent civilians on purpose hamas does big difference'
p196
aS'terrorist organization existance should not be tolerated anywhere they should be destroyed'
p197
aS'hamas is not al qaeda they are probably supporters but hamas are terrorists themselves and shouldnt be tolerated'
p198
aS'out completely of all hamas members and supporters its the only way to destroy a terrorist organization completely'
p199
aS'and the people in gaza want hamas to lead them that makes the gaza area a terrorist controlled area which should be wiped'
p200
aS'israel breeches a ceasefire hahaha thats rich hamas uses terrorist tactics they are a terrorist organization'
p201
aS'and if big if there are any innocent civilians in gaza i hope they escape but the rest need to be wiped out just end it'
p202
aS'im sure it was all of it but regardless hamas brought this on themselves with their attacks against israel'
p203
aS'that is specifically why they attacked in response to terrorist hamas attacks'
p204
aS'of hamas attacks and decided to do something about it'
p205
aS'how bout the terrorists attacking israel you know hamas the terrorists they control gaza and israel finally had enough'
p206
aS'how is that complicated'
p207
aS'how is this complicated hamas has launched over 1000 rockets into israel and israel is fighting back to end the attacks'
p208
aS'muslim terrorists'
p209
aS'my personal opinion kill every last member of hamas and their supporters they are nothing more than terrorists'
p210
aS'seriously simple they attacked israel indiscriminately killing civilians that makes them terrorists and worth wiping out'
p211
aS'end it israel once and for all sweep through gaza and execute all hamas and their supporters every last one '
p212
aS'since starting the operation in gaza we held our fire 4 times hamas never stopped shooting rockets retweet'
p213
aS'gunsense gun control'
p214
aS'looks to me like israel is just looking to end it once and for all i support them in their actions against hamas terrorists'
p215
aS'so most of yall are under the impression that israel doesnt have a right to fight back hamas started this crap'
p216
aS'a reminder to never take your freedom for granted these are iraqichristians leaving their homes because of isis'

p582
aS'thats one reason i go to 24hr walmart and shop in the ammo section every time'
p583
aS'i really dont think thats the right approach personally'
p584
aS'like the va dr actually told me if im not willing to push why should she bother seeing me at all'
p585
aS'starts making me think i behind or not doing something right makes me just want to stop altogether'
p586
aS'to be honest sometimes pple push too much with what they think i should be doing gets overwhelming'
p587
aS'im basically one day at a time sometimes hour at a time but the kids are good distraction for me'
p588
aS'and i check their homework everyday and go over all their schoolwork each week'
p589
aS'im in dallas not in my kids school so far as i know at least'
p590
aS'i read through some of them good info just not much interaction there'
p591
aS'so i work nights alone and only go to the grocery store walmart etc when have to'
p592
aS'proudly the biggest thing keeping me going is my kids'
p593
aS'i just cant deal very well with crowds and having pple walking behind me creepsmeout'
p594
aS'not that i have seen so far we are in texas so doubt it'
p595
aS'not sure of course but what shes been saying about school makes me think that something is going on'
p596
aS'school stuff which i think shes getting bullied but since shes the minority i think they ignore it'
p597
aS'im trying to teach good values the ones i grew up with work and honor those that deserve it'
p598
aS'gonna ask cause not sure if they even want a 9 yr old or have anything she can do'
p599
aS'i want her to learn the value of caring for those that sacrifice for her'
p600
aS'i dont know about all that but i am concerned about how my kids are raised'
p601
aS'simple stuff ya know spend time with some vets and talk etc keep some company if they allow it'
p602
aS'i just got an idea while im at the va tomorrow im going to see about volunteer work for her there'
p603
aS'i suspect her school is not teaching her correctly on that front'
p604
aS'yup and im going to start giving her constitution homework every week she needs to learn it'
p605
aS'i dont see anything wrong with staying home away from crowds etc ya know'
p606
aS'shes 9 and mom spoils her i refuse to raise a brat that thinks world owes her a favor'
p607
aS'yeah i prefer to stay home i feel safer here away from all the annoying and criminals'

p619
aS'i do appreciate the support though just hard with life moving on seems at light spd'
p620
aS'yup i agree and strangely i sleep better with my kids in the house too is that weird'
p621
aS'oh im not letting her just sit around and have fun no vacation from school here'
p622
aS'just hard to believe that some times you know'
p623
aS'not saying your not just that the va doesnt even do that much ya know'
p624
aS'just sad i get more help here than the va least yall act interested in how i am'
p625
aS'otherwise its a ok day focusing on her keeps me from thinking bout me so much'
p626
aS'shes been having problems too which adds toy stress a bit'
p627
aS'putting my daughter to work today and tomorrow she just got suspended from school'
p628
aS'and this would be constitutional how'

aS'hey you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for tx moms we support and 2a stay out of our state\xe2\x80\x99s business and our holsters'
p630
aS'meaning if your gun goes off even accidentally you will be held liable for what that bullet does not the business'
p631
aS'how is it a liability for the business and guess what you are responsible for any and all bullets that get fired'
p632
aS'and not being poor but choosing to make welfare a career does and if your here illegally hospitals should toss you out'
p633
aS'how do we pay for that exactly cause ive had to pay for every er visit when i didnt have insurance got a bill every time'
p634
aS'point is at least ins used to be affordable enough to allow lower income families to get it but not anymore'
p635
aS'course our definitions of poverty are probably a lot different whats yours no 70k luxury suv parked at their mansion'
p636
aS'if they are working full time then they shouldnt be living in poverty long as they live within their means'
p637
aS'hey doc hope all is well good luck in class whatever it is your studying'
p638
aS'we dont all have the same typical med expenses i shouldnt have to have a policy that covers female only issues im not female'
p639
aS'and agesex plays a role in what care you will need so it makes sense one would pay more than the other youngold manwoman'
p640
aS'subsidies have to be paid for from somewhere'
p641
aS'no creating insurance only the wealthy can afford and fining those that cant afford it in order to give free care to freeloader'
p642
aS'at least thats how i feel anyway'

p702
aS'and what bloodlust are you talking about i have no desire to spill the blood of anyone'
p703
aS'and i use mine to defend my home and family and those i protect at work a gun is a tool like any other misused can cause harm'
p704
aS'but it will work in a pinch like i said doesnt matter what a gun was designed for its what we use them for that matters'
p705
aS'my point is it doesnt matter i use a knife as a pry bar and screwdriver all the time wasnt designed to do either one'
p706
aS'commoncore needs to be stopped our nations future depends on it '
p707
aS'i have ptsd i keep it hidden because people look at you differently or think youre lying because you dont s\xe2\x80\xa6'

p709
aS'it is irrelevant what anything is designed to do i could kill with a bat knife hell a car or even a painting with heavy frame'
p710
aS'disarm the law abiding and make criminals safer in their work example all gun free zones which is where every mass shoot happens'
p711
aS'except your wrong the only pple that will even think about adhearing to unjust gun laws are the law abiding so all it does is'

aS'no its not just a self defense is legal state'
p725
aS'seriously not the cops choice gun was used arrest was mandatory according to sdpd'
p726
aS'the gangs have a tendancy to retaliate when pushed off a place'
p727
aS'the security officers were 2 black one white and getting gangs off the property was the job'
p728
aS'that state has lost their damn minds and i refuse to live with insane self defense law'

p769
aS'the 2ndamendment was not about slave patrols 2a rkba nra g\xe2\x80\xa6'
p770
aS'i would like to see a firearm safety or shooting class as an option something parents could sign their kids up'
p771
aS'true however the messege is still the same'
p772
aS'the key is to keep enough support against a given situation to keep it from happening'
p773
aS'ive been around the world 9 times no gov can do what their population does not allow them to do'
p774
aS'ok and that is conservative how no one in gov wanted that restriction'
p775
aS'i mean seriously i now have to pay the gov just because im still breathing'
p776
aS'what have they done thats conservative except maybe heller case'
p777
aS'i find it troubling the invites hategroups like amp spends taxpayer dollars entertaining th\xe2\x80\xa6'
p778
aS'and i gotta work all night in it ugh'

p783
aS'ah yes  the cruel lives of poor youth in america nypd disperses riot over 250 sneakers '

p785
aS'the original homeland security 2a nra pjnet orpuw molonlabe tgdn tcot rednationrising ccot teaparty'
p786
aS'the 2a was written specifically for times when a fickle majority vote could repeal the 2a nra nj2as pjnet'
p787
aS'no its not a collective right you cant pick and choose what is in the 2a it has always been an individual right'
p788
aS'and the sky is blue but that doesnt change my right to keep and bear arms make it illegal for them oh wait it is already'
p789
aS'and i believe thats where libs always get it wrong they dont read and comprehend the meaning thats the confusion i think'
p790
aS'but 2a is giving the a reason for the no infringement of the right to keep and bear arms not a requirement'
p791
aS'thats discrimination so it would have to be all able bodied citizens'
p792
aS'some people just need a sympathetic pat'
p793
aS'sorry but the right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the constitution best get used to it guncontrol fail'
p794
ag123
aS'thats cause we gun owners fight them to keep american rights intact'
p795
aS'and what is a militia armed citizens private weapons and ammo no armed citizens no militia'
p796
aS'gun control is illegal in the united states'
p797
aS'while i agree those people should not have guns 2a makes gun control illegal want it to be legal amend it otherwise'
p798
aS'thats why if your honest when you read 2a you understand gun control is illegal in the us period'
p799
aS'well regulated didnt mean rules and restrictions like it does now'
p800
aS'you are putting 2014 definition on a 1791 writing it doesnt work that way'
p801
aS'and if i got the money to spend on stockpiling weapons and ammo why should i not be allowed to'
p802
aS'who is talking about stockpiles im talking in about carry for protection whats wrong with that'
p803
aS'and what would you consider warranted carrying in a holster on my hip'
p804
aS'well regulated ment properly working and besides that no militia without armed citizens'
p805
aS'you seem to not understand what that means'
p806
aS'i watched it happen in afghanistan not once but 3 times one got stopped once and hung himself anyway'
p807
aS'true your not the only one that has seen that but tell me how does taking away my rights change any of that'
p808
aS'neither do i but i believe honestly more guns less crime and you cant stop everything just not possible'
p809
aS'and if we still adhered to their policies and wishes this wouldnt be happening at all anyway'
p810
aS'thats a cop out you want to live protect yourself i do'
p811
aS'if they dont want to do it they wont pull the trigger and by the way its already law to not give guns to mentally ill'
p812
aS'taking away rights is not the answer especially from a veteran there is a better way im sure'
p813
aS'oh wait they are already doing that illegally i might add but its not easy and i prefer to err on the side of rights'
p814
aS'and how do you suggest we keep them away from guns take away everyones rights allow the va to take them'
p815
aS'i understand why they do it i dont agree but i do understand their thought process'
p816
aS'if they absolutely want to they will but it still does not make it gun violence its a suicide not a criminal attack'
p817
aS'wisdom and hilarity from the great tcot'
p818
aS'and the vets that are im sure are the same ones that have to use the va for med care and get refused benefits and pain mgmnt'
p819
aS'someone who wants to commit suicide will weather they use a gun or not they will find a way'
p820
aS'and where are these numbers'
p821
aS'even sandyhook parents dont think we need more guncontrol gt 2a nra tcot tgdn'
p822
aS'once they use that gun in a crime they are no longer a legal gun owner'
p823
aS'yup were well armed here but in chicago only the criminals have weapons'
p824
aS'are you really serious its not a violent crime being committed by a criminal'
p825
aS'really then why does chicago have a higher crime rate than dallas and houston put together'
p826
aS'sure self inflicted death not gun violence thats the difference'
p827
aS'banning magazines over 10 rounds wont reduce crime stop mass shootings read gt 2a tcot'
p828
aS'obamacare success depends on 30 million young healthy adults to signup for something they cant afford amp dont need pjnet ma\xe2\x80\xa6'
p829
aS'suicide is not a violent crime'
p830
aS'the fact is the better armed the community is the less crime and violence there is that is a fact'
p831
aS'these papers always lump suicide in with violent deaths murders and that way inflate the numbers'
p832
aS'uhm remove the suicides and the numbers change dramatically as in close to halved'
p833
aS'i have no issue with debating these pple i havent blocked anyone i lay out fact they call me racist and block lol'
p834
aS'you always know you won when they call you racist andor block u they cant handle fact based arguments'
p835
aS'yup so far i have been blocked by 3 pple today not satisfied till i hit at least 6 lol'

p985
aS'there are less resources per square mile on the border than were at that ranch i garuntee you that'
p986

p991
aS'and then we can be just like afghanistan a third world country at war with ourselves'
p992
aS'ok so by your logic they should stay here and just go out of business and leave everyone penniless and unemployed'
p993
aS'proud papa right here'
p994
aS'and teaching them to be self sufficient and how to defend themselves i have taught fhem how to shoot one even competes'
p995
aS'i agree and i do support stuff like solarwind power lowering emissions etc'
p996
aS'if a company can make big profits they can expand and pay more but if they cant we lose jobs here due to cost'
p997
aS'i want successful american comp in america but labor and hc and taxes limit their profits thats why they move'
p998
aS'because if as you say co are greedy hey are going to go where they can maximize profits and now that isnt usa'
p999
aS'you see there is the problem you want to limit profits that is why we keep losing jobs overseas right there'
p1000
aS'and i agree with that but that will never happen so long as dems controlled by labor unions to keep killing businesses'
p1001
aS'and it doesnt happen by heaping on more expenses to employers especially in a recession'
p1002
aS'like they used to do safe enviroment and decent wages used to be union policy but not anymore'
p1003
aS'exageration yes but i was making a point the unions want unreasonable wages now instead of working with a co to make it succeed'
p1004
aS'and make them a profit but unions think that the company is a money press with unlimited funds and puts them out of business'
p1005
aS'and unions take their share of that as well auto co for example cant pay 75hr per worker for a prod that will be affordable'
p1006
aS'yeah union and gov greed greed greed everyone know american made is quality problem is its now too expensive to make profit'
p1007
aS'if the unions would be reasonable it would work but they are not anymore they just want more and more and the company cant do it'
p1008
aS'and responsible now they are just as greedy companies cant afford to stay in business with unionized workforce'
p1009
aS'where do you get that from never said that'
p1010
aS'they hock cheap chinese crap because pple will buy it its all they can afford since manufacturing jobs went away'
p1011
aS'and without manufacturing no good jobs for the middle class to have buying power thats why walmart is so successful'
p1012
aS'no thats what responsible unions are for and with a strong middle class you improve the economy but without jobs no middle class'
p1013
aS'no the extra costs of healthcare and labor unions raising the avg pay to unsustainable levels for the company to stay in business'
p1014
aS'mainly healthcare and taxes req now'
p1015
aS'we have lost manufacturing in this country because of overregulation and over burdening the companies with requirments'
p1016
aS'djia'
p1017
aS'im not saying dont tax them but to ease up a bit and watch whay happens'
p1018
aS'by expanding they create jobs and good one especially in manufacturing but if you regulate and tax away that they cant'
p1019
aS'wrong employers need more of their profits in order to grow and expand'
p1020
aS'no if we taxed say auto makers less and peeled back some employment req then they would be able to hire more workers at better pay'
p1021
aS'increasing labor reg and requirments make products made here too expensive to make a profit so they move offshore simple economics'
p1022
aS'i buy american made myself costs more but its better quality problem is its getting harder to find because of dem tax policies'
p1023
aS'thats because the lib led senate regulated away all the jobs and made manufacturing in this country too expensive'
p1024
aS'what do you consider real jobs mcdonalds or construction electricians etc'
p1025
aS'dont forget fed land deals to china and bs fake research for snail mateing or some crap bridges to nowhere etc'
p1026
aS'i agree they did do good work now not so much'
p1027
aS'problem is we wont cut enough pork to pay for it because all the crap riders that get attached to the good bills'
p1028
aS'wealthy business ceos for repubs'
p1029
aS'and most of the contributions come from labor unions for dem candidates'
p1030
aS'and thats just one of many problems'
p1031
aS'which is why we cant afford to fixupdate our infrastructure too much fraud waste and abuse'
p1032
aS'possibly true but then dems keep putting the same pple into office instead of real reps that care about the country'
p1033
aS'and those wealthy should be in prison and let the poor take their seats in the senatecongress'
p1034
aS'and most of them are dem senators taking kickbacks for illegal backroom deals and cronies getting fed jobs shouldnt have'
p1035
aS'and those hedge fund douchbags should get sent to leavenworth military prison with the seriously hard criminals'
p1036
aS'agreed but so long as getting elected to congress means getting rich wont ever change thank you dems'
p1037
aS'oh you mean like reid who has been trying to take a ranchers land so he can sell it to china libs fault on that one'
p1038
aS'i care less where some rich asshole keeps his money i care more about what the gov is overspending on'
p1039
aS'no because we overspend on everything from defense to beuracracy and leave the vets to die slow painful deaths'
p1040
aS'should have let the banks car co and airlines go under something would have taken their place to fill the need'
p1041
aS'mostly at least the wars eehh sorta afghanistan i agree with iraq not at all still wondering why we did that one'
p1042
aS'wow never thought id say this but something we agree on'
p1043
aS'no it doesnt how do you come up with no gov from that of course we need a fed gov just limited in what it does not all powerful'
p1044
aS'and safe med care ha thats funny how many people die from malpractice and unnecessary med procedures every year'
p1045
aS'i never said no gov and most cops fire safety are paid for at the local level not fedral states are capable of that'
p1046
aS'and i give my opinion on whats happening i dont cuss at you notnice'
p1047
aS'fedral gov should run the army and repair infrastructer but instead they are researching mating habits of beavers or some crap'

aS'if he owes that much where is the gov eviction notice for taking his ranch 11mil and they dont collect no no way'
p1691
aS'there are plenty of admin ways they coild have taken the money from him'

p2383
aS'baharain'
p2384
aS'i want them to learn correct information not whatever he learned'
p2385
aS'what university did he teach at i want to make sure my kids never go there'
p2386
aS'so your telling me he is purposely violating the constitution then is that it'
p2387
aS'did he really well then that makes thing even worse i assumed he didnt know better'
p2388
aS'i guess that makes me smarter than you in that regard i dont waste money better spent elsewhere'
p2389
aS'i do not believe you must be rich to study history use all resources available'
p2390
aS'do you make this assumption because i dont waste money on artifacts'
p2391
aS'i love history and study it what time period exactly and what do you mean my kind'

p2394
aS'way back in 99'
p2395
aS'el capitan grad here'
p2396
aS'and that is your right to however your disagreement does not change the fact that it does discriminate'
p2397
aS'what about those whose state does not require a permit to carry at all do they not get the same protections under the law'
p2398
aS'im from san diego now living in texas because of the insane gun laws out there'
p2399
aS'i still believe that the permit requirement is the problem rights shouldnt need a permit to exercise'
p2400
aS'would be nice ill send an email about that to the nra leadership'
p2401
aS'so you always agree with the gov that makes you whats wrong with the country'
p2402
aS'and what has that got to do with me not really sure what your talking about now'
p2403
aS'some states have constitutional carry no permits required for any type of carry and guess what some of the lowest crime rates'
p2404
aS'and if not required in your state should not be required of you in any other state'
p2405
aS'now that would be great a concealed permit if required in your home state should be accepted in every state like drivers lic'
p2406
aS'in cali the permit class is over 300 again discrimination of the poor'
p2407
aS'i see that as discrimination under the guise of safety'
p2408
aS'and if that process were free i might agree in concept but its not and only restricts those that cannot afford it'
p2409
aS'that book is in the public realm by now and free to download on the internet somewhere'
p2410
aS'thats a nice old book but from the informational standpoint easily available'
p2411
aS'really whats the title i actually have several books written originally long ago'
p2412
aS'and i agree with you that ng is not a militia'
p2413
aS'its actually stated in article 1 section 8 of the constitution u may want to read it'
p2414
aS'invasion is not the militias only purpose or have you not actually read constitution'
p2415
aS'article 1 section 8 since the ng cant by itself its not a militia seems simple to me'
p2416
aS'and the militia is authorized by the constitution specifically to enforce law'
p2417
aS'true and if a court decides they are then we already have laws regarding that but thats not everyone laws apply to all'
p2418
aS'complete strangers that cant afford it'
p2419
aS'how much do the permit classes cost in your state are you going to pay for them for'
p2420
aS'and only for those you think should be allowed to defend themselves'
p2421
aS'so you think self defense should only be allowed at home then just trying to know where you stand'
p2422
aS'unless the fed deploys them'
p2423
aS'so congrats you wasted a lot of money apparently'
p2424
aS'and why buy a book when the text and information is easily found online'
p2425
aS'and you make assumptions again about what i can and cannot afford'
p2426
aS'and again you assume much and know little you have no idea what my guns cost'
p2427
aS'try me and most of your books are prolly liberal propaganda anyway'
p2428
aS'gets ratcheted up so much there without more complaints'
p2429
aS'been teaching that for more than 20yrs which is shameful and only reason gun control'
p2430
aS'i had to read and learn the constitution on my own as ca schools havent'
p2431
aS'not being combative just pointing out something you may have missed'
p2432
aS'so no deputizing would be necessary for the militia'
p2433
aS'big difference there and its in the constitution as a purpose of the militia'
p2434
aS'a called up militia already has the power to enforce law no deputizing necessary'
p2435
aS'they had to be deputized and were not functioning as a ng unit at that point legally'
p2436
aS'until called up'
p2437
aS'that again is where you are wrong texas has a state militia no funding required'
p2438
aS'yes you should i agree why dont you may learn how to stay on point'
p2439
aS'why is that do you assume i went to school here you would be wrong i grew up in cali'
p2440
aS'so why are you i make a point about one part and you suggest i read unrelated parts'
p2441
aS'militia must be able to be called upon to enforce law and ng cannot do so'
p2442
aS'also the ng cannot enforce law again means not a militia'
p2443
aS'except for the part where its a uniformed military service which means not a militia'
p2444
aS'no its not and your assumption is what your problem is you assume and know nothing'
p2445
aS'sure but it doesnt impact hiher right to do so no easy answers but restricting rights is never the right one'
p2446
aS'better than being a liberal and if hes a professor i worry for education in the us'

aS'not in the tea party although i do agree with some of their stances'
p2448
aS'have you read the whole thing or just the bits you like kinda like the president'
p2449
aS'22 you have to leave it at home unless you never leave your house at all'
p2450
aS'and thats how they get around the constitution but what good is owning a gun if12'
p2451
aS'seriously yall need to learn what your talking about'
p2452
aS'plus the amendments supercede the articles that was the purpose of the amendments'
p2453
aS'or give a requirement for citizens right to keep and bear arms so again what is point'
p2454
aS'i have and other than whos in command and why a1sec8 does not restrict militia'
p2455
aS'also mentions patents and currency'
p2456
aS'actually it refers also to post offices post roads and several others whats the point'
p2457
aS'driving is a privilege not a right i have my permits just dont agree with it'
p2458
aS'and the purposes for which the fed gov can call on a militia'
p2459
aS'the only mention of militias in article 1 section 8 is who can appoint commanders'
p2460
aS'ok and your question is i actually have a copy of the constitution what now'
p2461
aS'and until the constitution is changed legally the right to keep and bear arms is here'
p2462
aS'texas actually and i have my permits just dont agree with the necessity to have them keeps the poor from ability to carry'
p2463
aS'and the amendments are as much the constitution as every other part'
p2464
aS'not because they didnt agree amendments were added to protect the pple from the gov'
p2465
aS'i have also seen what happens to unarmed pple when criminals attack ill keep my guns thanks'
p2466
aS'the gun nothing the bullets yes i have i was in the army 5 12 yrs and deployed to afghanistan'
p2467
aS'close but no militia is commanded by military officer but compromised of armed citizens'
p2468
aS'i am against requiring permits to protect oneself from criminals'
p2469
aS'to prove i have the right to vote and carry'
p2470
aS'no id required to vote in most states right now and i have no issue with carrying id'
p2471
aS'yes i have and your point is'
p2472
aS'yes you do militia is not part of the standing army so national guard is not a militia'
p2473
aS'except what you think or feel doesnt make it fact and no it doesnt its part of the standing army'
p2474
aS'i dont blame a gun for what its operator does any more than i blame a car for drunk driver'
p2475
aS'never said not dangerous if used wrong just said its inanimate object'
p2476
aS'national guard is uniformed military service period part of the standing army so not a militia'
p2477
aS'militia come and go as they please use their own weapons equipment'
p2478
aS'ok sign up then when ordered to go to afghanistan refuse to go see what happens'
p2479
aS'driving and flying are not rights they are privileges'
p2480
aS'holy crap you dont really think the national guard is a militia do you cause its not'
p2481
aS'according to the constitution i do have a right to carry as i please but i follow the law'
p2482
aS'no armed citizens no milita you do know that right if not nothing more needs to be said'
p2483
aS'oh wow now that is a stupid argument its an individual right that makes a militia possible'
p2484
aS'the carrier is responsible for anything that happens while heshe is carrying it so whats the prob'
p2485
aS'point is its a right it shouldnt require a permit its not like driving a car'
p2486
aS'why require a permit at all it does nothing without a person operating it regardless of its size'
p2487
aS'it can no more act on its own than a stapler but thats beside the point i was trying to make'
p2488
aS'so it isnt an inanimate object then what gun ever acted on its own'
p2489
aS'i think requiring permits to carry an inanimate object is rediculas and stupid to begin with'
p2490
aS'to what and here in tx its the only option for those without concealed permits'
p2491
aS'whats wrong with rifles in public for that matter i dont understand why pple are so down on guns'

p2511
aS'of course they searching us vets are pissed and were all trained for war they scared of us'
p2512
aS'bet its less than the va spent on curtains'

aS'i have a feeling your right how much a year does the best dr in usa make'
p2514
aS'if not get our money back hire better doctors '
p2515

p2564
aS'we dont have to ask permission to buy ammo we have rights'
p2565
aS'what does that say about your dedication to them'
p2566
aS'except you seem to want to take away the very rights they signed up to defend so'
p2567
aS'and every memorial day i meet with my comrades families your point'
p2568
aS'so far not one is against open carrying citizens'
p2569
aS'law enforcement and yes they do i have this conversation with the cops i meet daily'
p2570
aS'your wrong about that one my friend cops almost universally support open carry'
p2571
aS'a lady in my church was in a nazi concentrationcampguess what she thinks of gun control'
p2572
aS'even cops want open carry to be legal ask one'
p2573
aS'i prefer the open carrier to the criminal that illegally conceals'
p2574
aS'no its a violence problem not a gun violence  problem'
p2575
aS'really where what kind of handgun what brand im always looking for a good deal'

p2577
aS'banning detachable mags would violate 2a read gt nra tcot tgdn pjnet ocra ccot'
p2578
aS'everyone has a capacity for violence given the right situation'
p2579
aS'and that proves what'
p2580
aS'i agree with this completely and so does my gf'
p2581
ag123
aS'isnt he jumping to conclusions as well'
p2582
aS'this is fact'
p2583
aS'i met the best and the worst people ive ever known while i was in the military'
p2584
aS'ill do it if they prove him guilty'
p2585
aS'and when they do like i said ill flop ol sparkys switch and watch him fry'
p2586
aS'prove hes guilty cause the alt is far worse'
p2587
aS'and my experience tells me their is at least one other possibility but i will be happy if they court martial this guy and'
p2588
aS'anyone anymore i have no reason to'
p2589
aS'so youll have to excuse my scepticism about blindly accepting their word doesnt mean i hope their lying just dont trust'
p2590
aS'and im left to fight with the va and incompetent drs constantly in pain for the rest of my life'
p2591
aS'yeah well they seem to be doing just fine one retired full benefits the other is almost there'
p2592
aS'i keep tabs on them to avoid them cause prison orange just aint my color but thats the only reason'
p2593
aS'only fair since both nearly got me killed twice'
p2594
aS'i out live them'
p2595
aS'yeah that would land me in prison only one reason ill be seeking out my sqd ldr or my plt sgt and thats to make sure'
p2596
aS'oh i still think it was a bad trade any way this comes out'
p2597
aS'i got some of it back from my soldiers that i was in charge of but they couldnt get it all since the plt sgt took some'
p2598
aS'gee thanks lol'
p2599
aS'so like i said not all platoon mates can be trusted to tell the truth when it matters'
p2600
aS'after i got hurt my platoon stole my property that was left behind and some of it was issued gear i had to pay for later'
p2601
aS'major problems or even tragedy i just want them to do the work and prove it is as they say it is'
p2602
aS'deployments are intense situations and emotions run high people are willing to go to extremes sometimes and that can cause'
p2603
aS'and my question is would they do something to him for it or do their job and keep him safe till they got back stateside'
p2604
aS'even i would say thats utter crap if he helped them ill gladly flip the switch on ol sparky myself'
p2605
aS'nope i didnt i did what i signed up to do even though i served with some that didnt i kept my word'
p2606
aS'and if they are telling the truth you are correct at best a deserter at worst a traitor'
p2607
aS'us army infantry and i did serve honorably and i was willing to put my life on the line everyday for my soldiers'
p2608
aS'very willing to do'
p2609
aS'i dont assume they are lying either i simply dont assume they are telling the truth blindly which it seems plenty are'
p2610
aS'i really do but experience has shown me never trust anyone to do other than what is in their own best interest'
p2611
aS'it all comes down to people no one does anything not in their own best interest and i hope im wrong here'
p2612
aS'no the point is the eyewitness accounts part if they would lie why not bergdahls platoon'
p2613
aS'all im saying is get evidence which im sure they have already if there is any and will be court martialing him soon enough'
p2614
aS'you mean like the eyewitness accounts of tillmans platoon the ones that all lied about what happened'
p2615
aS'when ya need to be lol'
p2616
aS'and they will willing follow wherever you lead them to hell and back if necessary and you marines are a damn scary bunch'
p2617
aS'thank you and its your gen turn now pay attention to your training and always put your subordinates before yourself'
p2618
aS'but beyond that im always proud to hear we still have young people willing to serve damn proud to hear it'
p2619
aS'i was army infantry 5 12 yrs been fighting with the va since jan 2010 the better kept your records the better off youll be'
p2620
aS'sad fact is if its not there the va will deny your claim just ask my dad and his 200k med bill debt'
p2621
aS'if it bruises bleeds or hurts for more than 24hrs get it in your med records '
p2622
aS'and for when you do have to deal with the va cause eventually u will'
p2623
aS'is he putting her in prison why say yay'
p2624
aS'good luck and stay safe put there devil dog'
p2625
aS'and why should i'
p2626
aS'that all this time my pc dr has abeen lying to me or b incompetent either way dont trust him at all'
p2627
aS'seriously i have finally started getting some pain relief from my pt and a traction machine which tells me'
p2628
aS'and if he does interfere thats a good case for undue command influence there'
p2629
aS'for the court martial and see whats what then'
p2630
aS'just on blind faith alone but i wasnt there when it happened so i prefer to wait'
p2631
aS'psychopaths type too so forgive me for being skeptical about taking them at their word'
p2632
aS'units are like that and i at least like to believe most are honest but ive served with the'
p2633
aS'thats not my experience actually i have seen the complete opposite but even i know not all'
p2634
aS'personally i really hope his unit members are telling the truth'
p2635
aS'that is correct but im waiting to see if he walked away or if something worse here'
p2636
aS'id like to see him get his day in court and thats most likely when well get the truth'
p2637
aS'thats very likely i agree but ill wait till his day in court to form my opinion'
p2638
aS'im sorry id prefer to see evidence not just peoples opinions'
p2639
aS'could be although it could also be something else far worse but like i said i wasnt there im not assuming either way'
p2640
aS'ultimately it is up to him to court marshal or not'
p2641
aS'cid would still do their job regardless of cic interference but ultimately he can decide no charges'
p2642
aS'true the cic hates us but still'
p2643
aS'could be although if they have evidance of desertiontraitor the army isnt acting on it otherwise cid would have him in custody'
p2644
aS'that wouldnt surprise me one bit'
p2645
aS'we leave no soldier behindunless hes on the wait list at the va or rotting in a mexican prison cell vascandal marin\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2646
aS'so thats another odd part of their story as well he isnt being charged with anything'
p2647
aS'if you were military you know they dont waste anytime going after you if they can get you for something'
p2648
aS'i think of it this way if they had evidence against him he wouldve been arrested by cid already and pending a courtmartial'
p2649
aS'neither would i believe him on his word alone either like i said i want proof one way or the other'
p2650
aS'but like i said im not assuming he is innocent but im not assuming hes guilty either not just on their word alone'
p2651
aS'and i agree his father is a douchebag no doubt about that'
p2652
aS'but that being said after my experiences blind faith in their words doesnt exist for me any more i want proof'
p2653
aS'and yes i trust vets a lot more than the gov by far a lot more'
p2654
aS'i didnt join up till 99 and deployed in 09 army changed a lot from the 80s to nowadays'
p2655
aS'i dont claim to know one way or another but im not bad mouthing the kid at least until proof one way or another'
p2656
aS'far worse than he walked off'
p2657
aS'i had a friend jump cause of our units treatment of him and nothing happened to that co either so yes the alternative is'
p2658
aS'and military units can be seriously hard on the members of the unit they dont like for some reason or another'
p2659
aS'i deployed with a couple of psychos and one my sqd ldr threatened me with my own weapon once so shit happens over there'
p2660
aS'reason or another but almost always they screwed up and someone got hurt'
p2661
aS'very few reasons for those outside of sf classified stuff one is the commanders attempting to protect themselves for some'
p2662
aS'carefully as you watch the locals'
p2663
aS'i hate to think that would be the case but it is a possible alternative over there you gotta watch your guys just as'
p2664
aS'crap happens over there and when it turns into a major tragedy the unit will close ranks and cover each other sometimes'
p2665
aS'like left him behind during a patrol or possibly a sick prank gone seriously wrong'
p2666
aS'if and a big if its the alternative it would mean his plt did something to get him captured'
p2667
aS'a trained soldier walks off without his weapon in that area the nda makes no sense either for the situation described'
p2668
aS'else is going on here or at least appears that way i hope it is as they say cause the alternative is worse'
p2669
aS'probably true but the story his comrades are telling just doesnt make sense and why the ndas something'
p2670
aS'this whole thing doesnt sound right they are trying really hard to destroy this guy makes me wonder what is the real story'
p2671
aS'i have no idea what really happened i wasnt there but just something odd about the whole thing'
p2672
aS'its really strange the whole situation is just out there weird it doesnt make any sense but i wasnt there'
p2673
aS'after listening to some interviews im still on the fence about weather his unit did something to get him lost'
p2674
aS'of course as well they should be against setting free five top terrorists'
p2675
aS'i agree with not negotiating with terrorists what made you think otherwise'
p2676
aS'well i try'
p2677
aS'me too i like lively debates some i win others i dont im not perfect lol'
p2678
ag123
aS'hey that could be never trust a politician they lie when their mouths move'
p2679
aS'thank you and hopefully it is as it appears and not as i fear it may be that would be far worse'
p2680
aS'no not at all i just come off that way sometimes i think'
p2681
aS'i hate to think my brothers and sisters in uniform would do that but it does happen and denial doesnt make it go away'
p2682
aS'me too'
p2683
aS'all want is pple to think more about what may be going on it may be as it appears and maybe its far worse'
p2684
aS'and then the unit closes ranks to mitigate the damage whatever that may be'
p2685
aS'and thats my point i never said he didnt just saying shit happens out there and mistakes turn into disasters'
p2686
aS'and if all they are doing is trying to discredit him because of something they did it makes sense'
p2687
aS'hey i dont like or trust potus either i think hes destroying the country'
p2688
aS'possibilities cause this wouldnt be the first time its happened'
p2689
aS'no nothing happened to them at all thats what happens when soldiers in a unit cover for each other thats why i see other'
p2690
aS'i used to until i deployed now never again'
p2691
aS'possibly but it will eventually come out what happened someone will get proof one way or another'
p2692
aS'and it got me hurt and another soldier seriously wounded'
p2693
aS'but i cannot and will not ever place my trust in anyone again because i served with some despicable pple'
p2694
aS'yes all coming from his unit that was under nda not to discuss it i truly hope its not the alternative really i do'
p2695
aS'and i hope your right and what happened is on him or the taliban but im not really hopeful about that'
p2696
aS'thank you but im no hero i just did what i thought was right'
p2697
aS'respectfully i dont agree all ive seen so far is opinions and mag articles'
p2698
aS'asses have you forgotten about the tillman debacle'
p2699
aS'ill believe what comes out of the investigation into what happened from cid not pple possibly trying to cover their'
p2700
aS'why i never claimed to know what happened only that it could be something else'
p2701
aS'i agree'
p2702
aS'and i dont care what pple think of me either never have never will'
p2703
aS'i never said i had perfect grammar or spelling and could care less your opinion of that'
p2704
aS'and you act as though thats actually important sorry but its just not'
p2705
aS'convenient simply because its believable'
p2706
aS'my point was that we shouldnt just accept any answer but investigate and find the truth and not just jump on whatever is'
p2707
aS'and it doesnt make my point invalid though there are other possibilities but without proof nothing is actually certain'
p2708
aS'yet no one takes shortcuts at 140 characters right'
p2709
aS'and if it comes out he is a deserter and a traitor well fine we have a court for that'
p2710
aS'yes thank you and im tired of pple jumping on this kid without proof'
p2711
aS'crap so yes i know enough to see a different possibility on what happened'
p2712
aS'i was in the army 5 12 yrs and deployed i have been in several units that treated pple like'
p2713
aS'oh boo hoo i have a grammar screw up and you think that makes the point invalid'
p2714
aS'lol not always im sure but im not going to pull punches just to save someones feelings i say what i mean mean what i say'
p2715
aS'i try to be at least and i dont jump on bandwagons just because its popular i try to think for myself'
p2716
aS'we should have just snatched him killed everyone holding him and shoved our pows back in their holes'
p2717
aS'i dont know details i do know fuck with my friends amp youre fucking wi\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2718
aS'im not saying it happened one way or the other but theirs just as much evidence either is possible just sayin'
p2719
aS'ive seen to many soldiers screwed by their units to not think something else is going on here'
p2720
aS'oh and doesnt anyone remember tillman the army unit would never lie to save themselves right'

aS'seriously rolling stone magazine you get your info from a music mag do u honestly think that proves anything'
p2722
aS'being captured making them also responsible for how he was released as well'
p2723
aS'and knowing the military like i do that makes it seem more like one or all of them are responsible for his'
p2724
aS'his unit members all pop up now with hateful statements sounds like they hated him before he disappeared'
p2725
aS'i think there is more to this than meets the eye'
p2726
aS'you forgot hearsay thats apparently also considered evidence these days'
p2727
aS'i agree julie a few emails and some statements from former comrades is not enough prove he did it or leave him alone i say'
p2728
aS'however saying you hate america doesnt make you a deserter one is opinion the other an action'
p2729
aS'and thats why they dont take him to court for it'
p2730
aS'and its possible he did nothing wrong'
p2731
aS'i agree it is suspicious as far as we know but the only pple that actually know the truth are the ones there'
p2732
aS'yes and i for one will reserve my judgments till after that if it ever happens'
p2733
aS'agreed all i ask is its proven first'
p2734
aS'but this reaction this fast is a bit suspicious i mean he didnt even get back to the us before getting attacked'
p2735
aS'believe anything he said if he is a traitor i say prove it and then zap him ill flip the switch'
p2736
aS'i mean seriously this just seems like a lot of push to discredit him like if he makes an accusation now who would'
p2737
aS'i just cant put my finger on it i dunno maybe im over thinking but just something weird here'
p2738
aS'i would hate to think thats the case of course but just something isnt right'
p2739
aS'i dunno it seems almost like his unit did it to him or something thinking he wouldnt make it back'
p2740
aS'dont get me wrong i cant stand obama but this situation doesnt seem right to me something else going on here'
p2741
aS'something is wrong with this whole situation why nda the other members of his unit why didnt he take his weapon'
p2742
aS'dont trust the government we dont'

aS'well thank you very much'
p2744

p2746
aS'generally speaking its only done with sf guys unless the whole unit or its commander is at fault for something illegal'
p2747
aS'my question what did the unit do that prompted the nda thats the first question needs answering here'
p2748
aS'agree wholeheartedly with that'
p2749
aS'courage'
p2750
aS'did just saying something is seriously fishy here if all he did was walk off why the silence papers something else here'
p2751
aS'so what happened that they had to sign non disclosure agreements did they give bergdahl to the taliban  not saying they'
p2752
aS'however prove he did wrong and ill gladly flip the switch on ol sparky but without proof leave him alone let him go on withlife'
p2753
aS'if he can be considered guilty without proof and just accusations then any of us could also even if we are innocent'
p2754
aS'it just doesnt track with what is being said about him wanting to fight for the other side why go unarmed'
p2755
aS'im not saying thats what happened but i find the whole situation suspect a trained soldier walks off in afghanistan unarmed'
p2756
aS'it happens a lot in the military and once the ncos start doing it its all over for the target weather he did anything wrong'
p2757
aS'i have served with pple that so harangued a guy he jumped off a roof when his transfer request was denied and i blamed them'
p2758
aS'and if he has proof of that hand it to cid and let him be court martialed for his crimes otherwise its just his opinion notproof'
p2759
aS'then this country is in real trouble'
p2760
aS'what proof magazine article well if thats what passes for proof these days'
p2761
aS'is there proof he is a traitor if so we court martial bergdahl if not leave him alone and let him try to get on with his life'
p2762
aS'same here but there still isnt any proof he was a deserter yet'
p2763
aS'so do i unfortunately some people have skipped hope and have gone straight to deciding its tr\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2764
aS'no get answers and then act not get lies from pres and do nothing'

p2774
aS'im not saying dont prosecute im saying make sure there is something to prosecute'
p2775
aS'and i for one would prefer not to accidentally send an innocent man to death'
p2776
aS'its not like he didnt shave or forgot to shine his boots its a death penalty offense'
p2777
aS'i agree and i choose to reserve judgement until some sort of proof cause thats a serious accusation'
p2778
aS'can you link to it im unaware of that article and no offense but an article isnt proof of wrongdoing'
p2779
aS'i must be behind in checking the news'
p2780
aS'then hes been arrested and is being prepped for court martial right'
p2781
aS'hes a deserter really  were you there did you watch him do it if so why didnt you say something earlier than now'
p2782
ag123
aS'if he is a deserter then its possible obama knew and made the swap to release his comrades'
p2783
aS'is just as believable as him just walking off dont get me wrong if he did it hang his ass but i want proof first'
p2784
aS'i agree if he did just walk away but at this point its just as likely his co handed him to them without proof anything'
p2785
aS'and we should wait to villify this young sgt till after we know what actually happened'
p2786
aS'i cant spend money on things like that but there is a program gives guitar and lessons im on a waiting list for'

aS'dont get me wrong i like the feeling of being appreciated i just dont want to appear arrogant about it'
p2876
aS'you know i appreciate that just dont know how to respond to being thanked for doing my duty whats right'
p2877
aS'so you see your not just another vet your doing what the rest of us wish we could be heard'
p2878
aS'because you have a microphone so i appreciate that you are using that help the rest of us who get ignored'
p2879
aS'you see i could scream all day the same thing you whisper and you would be heard and i ignored'
p2880
aS'i wish it were different but thats a fact'
p2881
aS'no offense but your wrong your not just another vet you have a voice that pple listen to unlike most vets'
p2882
aS'so it is great to see you using that voice to help instead of ignore the problems with distractions'
p2883
aS'stuff trying to be heard without a platform to do so unlike you who has that platform'
p2884
aS'except for the fact that your voice is payed attention to unlike the rest of us vets who say the same'
p2885
aS'i agree lets find out if the son is guilty of something before we go convicting the son for fathers actions'
p2886
aS'i like your idea of opening up all the military hospitals we need care now not in six months or a year'
p2887
aS'or not depending on what they find of course'
p2888
aS'it may not be as it appears but let the army investigators have their say first then condemn the guy'
p2889
aS'you know what i mean its always a bit uncomfortable to me for that reason i dont know maybe im just over thinking'
p2890
aS'but never really know how to respond i dont want to appear arrogant or anything like i feel thanks are required'
p2891
aS'i never know what to say thank you your welcome i honestly dont know what to say im glad of the appreciation'
p2892
aS'they find as much as the next guy'
p2893

aS'sorry u are right im just saying an accusation like this can be as good as'
p2903
aS'accuse anyone of anything without some sort of proof'
p2904
aS'dont get it screwed up i believe this needs to be investigated but we shouldnt'
p2905
aS'true however has he been proven to be a deserter or is that just what u think'
p2906
aS'and no amount of magazine articles are going to prove that sorry'
p2907
aS'but as a member of the army he is innocent until proven guilty'
p2908
aS'and if that is the case courtmartial him prove it and hang him as a traitor'
p2909
aS'but until the facts are out i say we welcome our soldier home and help him deal with his issues'
p2910
aS'party where did you get his emails you see everyone has their idea of whats going on'
p2911
aS'and if he is i will be the first to demand he be hung as such but not before'
p2912
aS'and i agree with that bo has a lot to answer for but that doesnt make bergdahl a traitor'
p2913
aS'so tell me were you there you seem to know what happened without other proof'
p2914
aS'but to me so long as he wears that uniform we cannot and will not leave him in enemy hands'

aS'alright as long as startling me wasnt your intention'
p113
aS'the mentioning of the next death shook her up as the pencil was shaking terribly in her hand'

p822
aS'\xe2\x80\x93cupboards starting the machine as it heats up the water inside itll take a couple of minutes for it to brew'

p824
aS'\xe2\x80\x93probably a few feet away from the couch'
p825
aS'how do you prefer your coffee she poked her head from behind the kitchen counter which was close to the living room\xe2\x80\x93'
p826
aS'\xe2\x80\x93done prior to her condition she had felt some guilt about shutting herself away but she knows shes recovering'
p827
aS'\xe2\x80\x93a tad bit happier with having company over this was one of her moments where she missed doing some of the things she had\xe2\x80\x93'
p828
aS'alright then come on in she opened the door wider for chris to walk through and remained smiling she seemed to be\xe2\x80\x93'

aS'hmm she flicked her ears making her way to her front door she twisted the doorknob and opened the door hello'
p837
aS'\xe2\x80\x93she choses to wake up'
p838
aS'\xe2\x80\x93stretch a little bit she forgot that sleeping in her chair made her feel all stiff and ugh in the morning or whenever\xe2\x80\x93'
p839
aS'she woke from her sleep and blearily rubbed her eyes hmm oh looks like hes gone nightshade would get up from her recliner and\xe2\x80\x93'
p840
aS'\xe2\x80\x93blanket up over herself and dozed off snoring almost every few seconds'
p841
aS'she sat down on her recliner and leaned it back far enough to obtain a comfortable sleeping position she pulled her\xe2\x80\x93'
p842
aS'\xe2\x80\x93recliner on the other side of the living room'
p843
aS'she smiled and chuckled again she then stroked his hair softly sort of what a mother would do and started towards her\xe2\x80\x93'
p844
aS'\xe2\x80\x93she gently tucked him in which was a habit of hers one that she often teases herself about'
p845
aS'she watches and chuckled in slight amusement thats adorable she brought over the blanket draping it over him as\xe2\x80\x93'
p846
aS'\xe2\x80\x93one of her extra throw blankets and paused slightly glancing towards chris wonder why hes so tired'
p847
aS'\xe2\x80\x93carefully guiding him to the couch even though he was passed out and gently laid him down on it she then went to grab\xe2\x80\x93'
p848
aS'she blinked for a small moment before she halfcarried halfdragged chris into the front door of her house she was\xe2\x80\x93'
p849
aS'oh dear she knelt down and lifted him up by his shoulders you definitely need some sleep'
p850
aS'she got to her feet and brushed herself off recognizing chris after he got out of his vehicle um my house'
p851
aS'had come from her being startled'
p852
aS'\xe2\x80\x93backwards in a non intended comedic fashion her initial shock was ebbing away and she felt relived that nothing else\xe2\x80\x93'
p853
aS'the sudden noise of the car horn caught her off guard and she yelled in surprise losing her balance and falling over\xe2\x80\x93'
p854
aS'\xe2\x80\x93window as an attempt to see if the person inside would respond hhello she tapped on the window a second time'
p855
aS'she attempted to peer in through the windows even though it was impossible to do so she then gently tapped on the\xe2\x80\x93'
p856
aS'\xe2\x80\x93she carefully stepped off her porch and hesitantly inched towards the car now who could this be'
p857
aS'she flicked her ears at hearing the vehicles approaching her house and slightly tilted her head setting her tea down\xe2\x80\x93'
p858
aS'\xe2\x80\x93anticipation of it made her a little anxious and she quickly sipped her cup of lavender tea that she had handy'
p859
aS'she cast a slightly concerned glance towards the sky she was half expecting a firework to come out from nowhere an explode the\xe2\x80\x93'
p860
aS'\xe2\x80\x93quietly sighed and looked out from the safety and security of her porch as she leaned back in her chair'
p861
aS'\xe2\x80\x93little bit paranoid especially on cinci de mayo counting that the possibility of fireworks going off was high she\xe2\x80\x93'
p862
aS'\xe2\x80\x93if too many what if thoughts running through her mind she couldnt help it its wasnt her fault that she felt a\xe2\x80\x93'
p863
aS'nightshade would glance around curiously it was cinco de mayo and she half wanted to leave the porch of her house but she had several\xe2\x80\x93'

p868
aS'she seemed to flinch and she quickly shook her head to snap herself out of her trance yyeah it was just a trance'
p869
aS'that the danger never tends to go away that its always there maybe she would lightly shrug still seeming entranced'
p870
aS'yeah in a few similarities she lightly chuckled only to pause for a second seeming halflost in her thoughts'
p871
aS'track record she furrowed her brows for a few seconds no not like that more like trying to stay out of danger\xe2\x80\xa6'
p872
aS'she lightly nodded i usually dont talk about my past occupations its a topic id prefer to avoid'
p873

p1157
aS'she could feel her hands heat up and pressed them to the ground \xe2\x80\xa6 unexpectedly a small ring of flames surrounded her'

p1635
aS'and break the awkward silence'
p1636
aS'are you still up for a little something to eat im actually getting a little hungry myself she would smile to try'
p1637
aS'i agree as beautiful as it may be it is very destructive she flicked her wrist igniting a flame on her fingertips'

p1639
aS'pyrokinesis and teleportation i used to be in the military so i was using those abilities against enemies'

aS'yes i do its a field that i decide to take on because i want to use my abilities to help people rather than to destroy'
p1642

p1656
aS'nightshade nodded lightly and paused before she gave the wolf another hug she was a little saddened as she didnt know'
p1657
aS'alright one method i learned was meditation you must have you mind cleared of as many thoughts as you can manage'
p1658
aS'your mind off of whats troubling you um does going for a bite to eat sound okay'
p1659
aS'nightshade would tighten the hug and held it for a few seconds longer before she let go i want to try and maybe take'
p1660
aS'oh okay although i could possibly suggest methods that dont require as much violence that is if you dont mind'
p1661
aS'oh nightshade tensed up a little bit she remembered for a moment when she used to use a weapon out of anger'
p1662
aS'gently reached out to give the wolf a small hug as an attempt to try to comfort him'

p2213
aS'her breath got stuck in her throat and felt the fear gnaw at her she started shaking a tad bit the hidden alter ego'
p2214
aS'back towards the mirror and she nearly yelped from being startled'

aS'looked like some sort if figure behind her she turned her head and found nothing confused she turned her attention back'
p2216
aS'she entered the bathroom and using the mirror she started fixing her hair up something caught the corner of her eye it'
p2217

p2346
aS'kneeling on the ground she grasped the sides of her head and gritted her teeth willing her vehement alter ego to vanish'

p2362
aS'she lightly nodded yyeahyou did she popped the pills into her mouth and swallowed them slightly scrunching her nose'

aS'blinks as if stunned well theres some clothes upstairs that you can use'

p2490
aS'it has been nine days since she last took her medications she felt surprisingly calm almost normal as she would say today seems nice'
p2491
aS'she started strolling down the sidewalk it was a lot more comfortable than she thought it was and she was smiling as she walked on'
p2492
aS'i i actually did it i i made it the hedgehog stood stunned at the edge of her yard and looked around  this is amazing'
p2493

p2505
aS'finally realizing that there was nothing there she released a heavy sigh of relief chuckling lightly she then fixed her posture'
p2506
aS'she felt on edge this made her hypersensitive to her surroundings looking every which way to ensure that there was nothing after her'
p2507
aS'the hedgehog would look in both directions and slightly glance behind her it had been two days since she had taken her medications so'
p2508
aS'completely doubtful about it since she has accepted the fact that her pills arent any use'
p2509

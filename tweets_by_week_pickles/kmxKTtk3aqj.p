p10
aS'clean house kids immediately start to put things out of place which i assume is an evolutionary territorymarking'
p11
aS'congratulations are a job well done im assuming this bc thats my most common cause of painful feet and its the case today'
p12
aS'nothing says you deserve a drink like painful feet'
p13

p19
aS'if you dont know the difference between die and dye youre going to end up dead instead of having purple hair'

aS'i was there for way too long but i wanted to see people some of whom i didnt get to see'
p31
aS'introversion at its finest my bro needed us to watch his kid while he amp a bunch of people worked on the house'
p32
aS'you obviously cant give that little bit of life perspective the other person has'
p33
aS'i think part of it is that i am pretty certain the fake other side of the conversation is what the other person would say'
p34
aS'me too sometimes i have conversations in my head and have to ask if they have happened because they were realistic'
p35
aS'go add it before you forget again  thingsthathavehappenedtome'
p36
aS'then instead of adding it immediately you think about when you thought you did it amp what must have happened to distract you'
p37
aS'a point or several points whatever'
p38
aS'thank you those werent my words but it was a point i tried making a week or so ago'
p39
aS'there was internet in 1998 maybe people just didnt want them'

p41
aS'im going to pottermore and hogwarts online school in honor of the day'

p44
aS'thank you its so nice to have this conversation openly you have a good night im off to bed'
p45
aS'to the cause and the message'
p46
aS'who i like and respect otherwise to see that and think about where they stand and how they behave i want them to remain true'
p47
aS'i still think its a significant issue that needs to examine as whatever kind of activist a person is and i want the people'
p48
aS'and im not saying what you said was a mistake there was no intent to sexually assault him even in a joking context'
p49
aS'people should be understanding when mistakes are made they will happen'
p50
aS'i actually do go out of my way with language i know could be harmful but obviously im not perfect nobody is and thats why'
p51
aS'so you did what i just did for basically the same reason i did good for you'
p52
aS'and phrases but not everything is'
p53
aS'your joke was in context so she was stretching her interpretation i hate when people do that yeah there are problem words'
p54
aS'i saw that that happened i didnt see who did it i wanted to comment but since i didnt have complete context i stayed out'
p55
aS'but honestly us dissecting this is enough of a problem amp we should just continue trying to be better people amp help the world'
p56
aS'more specifically its personal politicking which detracts from the larger issuesthe things that actually matter'
p57
aS'the worst part is that so many people who actually are fighting for better are boxed out for not having this exact viewpoint'
p58
aS'and sometimes need to be recognized as the best social justice warrior capitalized because its a title'
p59
aS'the thing is sj at its core is a good thing its when its poorly executed or used to abuse that it becomes a bad thing'
p60

p67
aS'and they dont even water the fucking flowers'
p68
aS'actually this game is supposed to be relaxing and i find myself more and more annoyed whenever i see what inconsiderate thing was done'
p69
aS'allowing others to be in your acnl town takes away a bunch of the fun bc they ruin your flowers amp take away all incomemaking things'
p70
aS'and was the booth an homage to twin peaks i got a black lodge vibe but it might not have been intentional'

p230
aS'fuck why do you make me like you'
p231
aS'i want to say thanks but im pouting too much at nat for the words to come out'
p232
aS'im okay with sharing what i told her'
p233
aS'those of you who are still around thanks for listening to me i dont usually display this much vulnerability i appreciate your patience'
p234
aS'thank you this is hard but its important'
p235
aS'the worst part none of you to whom im directing this will acknowledge it you probably wont even see it not that itll change anything'
p236
aS'i wanted to know if it was an emotional response or logical ive since come to the conclusion its logical'
p237
aS'in all honesty ive been harboring anger at her for two years its why i took days to process'
p238
aS'this is who you are defending'
p239
aS'it wasnt just me it was others this is her pattern if you sniff out the liar you are blacklisted you become the outcast'
p240
aS'i didnt have the guts to come out when she treated me badly though i did privately discuss it with others most excused her'
p241
aS'no this is several days in the making i just processed completely today'
p242
aS'this is everything ive been getting about today'
p243
aS'not all criticism are from haters not all complaints are from people with an ax to grind sometimes people just want you to\xe2\x80\xa6'
p244
aS'i tried to stay out but i have to live with myself if i just ignore it'
p245
aS'im just another person who wont swallow your destructive brand of feminism'
p246
aS'ive never been so vocal as now i dont care if you hate me im just another person to add to your list of people who wont comply'
p247
aS'this is me saying im done with skirting on the edges of your extremism you dont represent actual feminism you represent hatred'
p248
aS'i dont want to associate w people who go against what they say to defend a person who went against everything on which she built her rep'
p249
aS'i do not want to associate with people who are okay with another person who harms others'
p250
aS'and i dont want to be associated with anyone who supports lying manipulative people in the name of feminism thats not feminism'
p251
aS'im going to try to make something good out of this'
p252
aS'and if you dont know you did that to me you probably are doing it to others'
p253
aS'my first goal in shedding people who have made me feel like i can never do enough or be enough is doing something'
p254
aS'maybe one day ill even be happy and part of that will be because you let me see that it was okay to be at odds with yourself'
p255
aS'i still want to thank those people for giving voice to my own hate of self that has existed unrecognized i now can fight it'
p256
aS'im sorry to those who have been taken down by the blades of injustice in the name of justice'
p257
aS'this is not me judging individual morality its me judging hypocrisy'
p258
aS'ive come to terms with this and cannot support anyone who does this i even have examined my own complacency in this'
p259
aS'too many people live in a world of different shades of gray depending on at whom they are looking or applying their moral code'
p260
aS'i think we tried at 4 but she didnt sit amp watch we tried again at 7 amp she did but so did the 2yo it depends on the kid'

aS'thank you and its the business that is pissing me off so thats not a problem'
p269
aS'it depends on the job i dont think its bad but trimming a beard is never a bad idea when a potential job is involved'
p270
aS'what pains me most about this is people i like are part of that community that makes me feel inadequate'
p271
aS'yeah i know but this is a strange situation i cant really go into details'
p272
aS'i know theres more in life than that but its be nice to have that more often'
p273
aS'truth i have a problem with some other people and i dont want to get into specifics it could have untold repercussions'

p299
aS'and then i think to myself that maybe im the one who is missing something and maybe im wrong but the feelings persist'
p300
aS'im not saying everyone is being that way but there are times when i think it and i respect and admire many people who make me think it'
p301

p302
aS'my nudes put strickland propane on the map'
p303

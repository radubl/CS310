aS'giving any testimony means you must relive the events of that in\xc3\xa7ide\xc3\xb1t'
p705
aS'boo hoo for jodi she should have thought of what it would be like to testify before she killed travis'
p706
aS'sure im all for that too lets include all the self imposed ailments'
p707
aS'remember its entirely possible they never even had a sex or any of that stuff that shes allegingagain no proof'
p708
aS'jodi is just angry at herself because she did not stop him from taking advantage of her  her bad'
p709
aS'shes like women who confuse love and sexnuthin new about that but most dont kill over it'
p710
aS'contrary to the tears she has not shed thus far'
p711
aS'i saw an insession commercial about a case in michigan if any of your staff visits here id like to take you to lunch'

p727
aS'same here'
p728
aS'i didnt have as good a memory as she does when i was 5 years old '
p729
aS'either she has a great memory or shes a heck of a liar'
p730
aS'either she has a very good memory or shes a terrific liar'
p731
aS'i suspect not until next week because theres no court tomorrow or friday'
p732
aS'however itll take the jury 3 days to ask their questions lol '
p733
aS'betty broderick who was truly abused emotionally and psychologically and convicted was more emotional on the stand than jodi'
p734
aS'she is just telling a story of 2 people in a relationship with a woman getting the short end of the stick  big deal'
p735
aS'they have to blow everything out of proportion because they have no other defense'
p736
aS'you are so right'
p737
aS'jean how did they end up in jodis bedroom in the first place hint hint'
p738
aS'jodiarias lets not confuse her with a battered womanshes a grown womancapable of walking away abused as a child bunk'
p739
aS'exactly  she never said no or told him to stop'
p740
aS'she got the wrong coaching on that question'
p741
aS'all shes telling the jury is she was using sex to try to keep travis which looks not good for her'
p742
aS'what she really said to the defense attorney is she was using sex bait to get travis which wouldnt set welll with the jury'
p743
aS'jodi sure gave me the wrong answer to her defense attorney on the oral sex question she should have said cuz i felt intimidated'
p744
aS'so far she has said nothing about him being abusive to her'
p745
aS'so far she hasnt said anything about him abusing her or her saying no to him'
p746
aS'discomfort is totally different from feeling awkward which is what she really means'
p747
aS'like if youre asked for an alibi amp u say u stopped at store went to the dry cleaners have drappmt rented some movieso'
p748
aS'because of all the abuse jodi took   im wondering if it just built up inside her and she took it out on travis'
p749
aS'and just skip over it real quick like jurors will focus on others who is she kidding'
p750
aS'as long as its taken her so far shell get to the relationship about travis'
p751
aS'jodi will have another birthday by the time we get to hearing about travis and how he was killed'
p752
aS'ive never seen a defendant present self defense testimony in such an unusual style'
p753
aS'thats what travis thought too'
p754
aS'do you feel what she has said is truly meaningful and true'
p755
aS'too much of what she has said is ordinary things that happened to many people'
p756
aS'everyone will forget what she has said by the time she gets to talking about travis'
p757
aS'jodi will be another year older by the time she gets to talking about travis'
p758
aS'where is she going with this conversation'
p759
aS'are they rolling their eyes or clicking their tongues lol'
p760
aS'are you underwhelmed or is it just me'
p761
aS'beth what do you make of the jurors actions'
p762
aS'her testimony is way too ordinary for what she did'
p763
aS'i had a high school boyfriend hold a gun on me and another who tried to choke me and i never killed anyone'
p764
aS'defense should have gotten more solid evidence under their belt before putting jody on the stand this is pretty meaningless'
p765
aS'you got that right'
p766
aS'i noticed she used some words that were unusual for her vocabulary too'
p767
aS'what she has been through is nothing extraordinary many people have been through worse and didnt kill'
p768
aS'i was supporting myself on my own 3 months before i was out of high schoolhad my own apartment worked 2 jobs'
p769
aS'thank god prayed for a good outcome for several days'
p770
aS'if jodi wanted to commit suicide she could have done it much sooner when she would have had a better chance of succeeding'
p771
aS'again wheres the beef'
p772
aS'she already made several mistakes about the time line and her age at which she did different things'
p773
aS'the fact that jodi said she was going to commit suicide is it just another lie like her other lies'
p774
aS'is this anything like casey anthonys father falling on the sword for her'
p775
aS'she didnt say a word about photography why not '

p543
aS'only a couple consistently but i try out mp on games often on usedborrowed games'
p544
aS'well that was s argument payg would be cool but hard to implementkeep track of'
p545
aS'which was my point of paying \xc2\xa38 pass for 5 games you may as well have bought ps'
p546
aS'youd dont agree with used games or you dont agree with online pass fees for used games'
p547
aS'and that might be just trying the mp you might hate it then youd have wasted money'
p548
aS'online passes are like what \xc2\xa38 play 5 used games in a year and youve paid for a ps sub'
p549
aS'exactly thats the way ps4 is going because they know people will pay the sub'
p550
aS'people will pay though people paid for xbl and its currently arguably a better service than what ps3 has'
p551
aS'maybe wed get dedicated servers instead of p2p with the extra revenue'
p552
aS'ah i havent caught up on the whole conference yet well maybe thats until the back catalogue builds up'
p553
aS'exactly annual is the best price i cant see them doing it on an adhoc play basis'
p554
aS'huh next rotation were getting 3 games two of which are u3 and lbpkarting'
p555
aS'i doubt that will happen tbh youd have to go for a shorter sub length if you want a cheaper price'
p556
aS'its currently \xc2\xa33999 a year which is pretty reasonable its worth it for instant game collection which has been stellar on ps3'

p250
aS'thank you so much unfortunately i am not alone  there are lots of motherspatients affected i am in touch with'

aS'what is more she has been misdiagnosed'
p253
aS'my daughter is already becoming disabled on the drugs'

aS'join us for a tweetchat about bedlam friday at 1230pm with our medical director amp the series producer'

aS'however much money is being wasted under mental health services when care is not working drain to nhs'
p260

p261
aS'especially when so much money is being wasted as i am highlighting very sad indeed'
p262
aS'brilliant i fully agree'
p263
aS'yes because of greater understanding from someone who has been through trauma themselves and listens for a change'
p264
aS'i quite agree because for some there are underlying health problems and they may on drugs that cause weight gain'
p265
aS'watching health freaks on tv  great show many natural remedys are amazing but dont make big pharmaceutical companie\xe2\x80\xa6'
p266
asS'2013_48'
p267
(lp268
S'but it is no good for some who are too drugged up to have the strength to ask for their records'
p269
aS'i do not agree as care has failed'
p270
aS'and 14 mind altering drugs later my daughter can barely walk and is worse than ever'

ag4
aS'i am disgusted that my daughter is being given contra indicated drugs'
p274
aS'womans baby forcibly taken from her womb by social services according to a report'
p275
aS'thats good however my greatest criticism is lack of disregard of physical health in favour in respect of my daughter'
p276
aS'i agree with you'
p277
aS'devasting as that person could be misdiagnosed and receiving wrong treatment and a lifetime of drugs that do not work'

p279
aS'cipralex gave my daughter the most adverse reaction amp that led to hospital admissionsrispiridone given to my youngest as a child'
p280

p283
aS'absolutely agree with you'
p284
aS'nothing surprises me at all  the cruelty and bullying that goes on is shocking amp i discussed this with paul burstow mp'
p285
aS'it is not just that  some patients cannot metabolize the drugs and that is why they are treatment resistant'
p286
aS'yes there needs to be choice and involvement by patients rather than exclusion and look at diet and assessments'
p287

p856
aS'some advocates have psychiatrists on their board so i have noticed'
p857
aS'mh law can easily be usurped'
p858

aS'i have challenged from the beginning when i saw the effects of these drugs'
p863
aS'instead of providing a facility to properly assess money is being wasted'
p864
aS'there are very few mps who care as i see it'
p865
aS'cipralex is a highly dangerous drug and caused shocking transformation in my daughter'

aS'wow that is remarkable it puts a strain on the family and affects everyone'
p872
aS'excuse is that i will stop the drugs but this requires specialist help amp i am just a mother'
p873
aS'and bullying tactics are used to get rid of you as nearest relative'

p876
aS'and not everyone can afford to visit and no assistance is given to the families'
p877
aS'you should see some of the letters i receive  only occasionally does this make news'
p878
aS'the drugs affect people in different ways and more than one is given at the same time'
p879
aS'there is a great need for choice and a specialist centre such as chy sawel'
p880
aS'this shows they could not care less about a patients wellbeing or physical health'
p881
aS'the drugs should only be used short term and when they dont work they continue to push them'
p882
aS'fact the drugs do not work for everyone  may be physical probs not assessed metabolization'
p883
aS'this affects the wider public with nhs closures of aampematernity when mh care is not working'
p884
aS'amp how much is this costing the taxpayer and the drugging going on leads to serious health probs'
p885
aS'sections can go on for years and years amp years to the point someone has no strength to contest'
p886
aS'young adults likewise can become very vulnerable under the influence of mind altering drugs'
p887
aS'i know people affected'
p888

aS'as i cannot write much on here i shall write to you personally'
p891
aS'sometimes they do not do a good job in promoting the drugs as i have discovered'

p893
aS'which label as every label given to my daughter has been wrong so far'
p894
aS'how can a minister label you same as how can social services re clozapine etc '
p895
aS'you are quite right'

aS'i thoroughly agree and the cep are doing this and what about april'
p902
aS'theres a lot going on behind the scenes but no one is helping my daughter'
p903
aS'promised drug free period of assessment but its all about clozapine here  i shd say clozapine and metformine off label'
p904
aS'and that is not surprising when experimentation is going on with no regard to physical health'
p905
aS'the more offensive he is the better as he is being extremely informative'
p906
aS'distance meant many families did not visit frequently at the bethlem  i could see by the visitors books'
p907
aS'certainly is misuse as these drugs should not be given to a child amp ive seen what harm they do'
p908
aS'then i would need to speak to you'
p909
aS'dr maccabes research is enough to put anyone off clozapine so if he is trying to promote it  what is he doing'

p919
aS'amp so many people were extremely interested in this and the presentation'
p920
aS'well i certainly have and provided research into physical illness being the cause'
p921
aS'and try saying that to the likes of my daughter who really knows'
p922
aS'well then you have to weight up the cost of long term health problems amp serious damage caused by these drugs'
p923
aS'it was simply not on offer to my daughter on discharge time and time again from hospital'
p924

p935
aS'i shall be listening to this again'
p936
aS'like i say many young peoples lives are at risk as id like to see some action and facilities provided like chy sawel'

aS'i wish you and my daughters could be there tomorrow with me and lorraine moss is waiting for her invitation'
p949
aS'excellent im hoping to share my increased knowledge with all the psychiatrists tomorrow at maudsley debates'
p950
aS'more cooperation between psychiatrists amp endocrinologists amp a lot less between psychiatrists amp drug companies is what is needed'
p951
aS'metformine mixed with clozapine prescribed by gp and psychiatrist separately are contra indicated drugs'
p952
aS'all the more reason for open dialogue  inclusion instead of exclusion opennesshonesty rather than secrecy'
p953
aS'and i know many who are decent parents but everything is based on assumption like diagnoses'
p954
aS'but there is lack of communication between teams especially when it comes to the drugs and physical health'
p955
aS'this is not always the case at all'
p956
aS'there may be many misdiagnosed re physical health probs not properly assessed'

p989
aS'my daughter would need a lot of support to get back into work ampwould need help to get to and from'

aS'some people would like a normal life but cannot have this due to the drugs prescribed'
p998
aS'the fact is there is no proof and my daughter all along could hve had a physical problem not properly diagnosed'
p999
aS'do not accept iagnosis for schizophrenia for my daughter as she has so many labels  i have another one on top of the world'
p1000

p1002
aS'i am still waiting to hear how you intend to go about improving psychiatry it is down tot he training in my opinion'

p1024
aS'my daughter has been in both and the care is the same enforced drugging for what i want proper assessments done'
p1025
aS'its ot just a case of underfunding many people cd be misdiagnosed and could have a physical illness'
p1026

aS'in fact anyone could be caused anxiety under those circumstances with a label that is not true'
p1043
aS'the drugs have caused anxiety and in addition shocking care on a hell on earth ward'

aS'and how much is it to keep elizabeth in the care home as opposed to home where she is happy'
p2516
aS'the whole system is wrong when social servs have to do assess first before an essential drug is alllowed'

aS'i have written to the new consutlant psychiatrist and will put this on my blog in a minute'
p2541
aS'no signs of aggression there have been no signs of anything  this is because nothing worked in the 1st place'
p2542
aS'it would not be safe to send elizabeth back as i have made a massive complaint like sending back an asylum seeker'
p2543
aS'in addition she is on beta blockers and senna but was not on all of this before she has said this has been since the chome'
p2544
aS'i want a full investigation into this overdrugging of my daughter she is looking better now and feeling better now'
p2545
aS'i have been told by an expert it is highly addictive but elizabeth has not needed it at all since coming home'
p2546
aS'isnt it better and fairer to wait until elizabeth has stabilised first they are pressuring to do it now'
p2547
aS'dont you think mr lamb that it is unfair to do an assessment when they have deprived drugs for 3 days'
p2548
aS'what are they doing she is not on a section or cto she does not want to go back and i want her home'
p2549

p2557
aS'it is a completely diff matter under mh amp im afraid that i can only commend david coffey of the nat psychosis unit'
p2558
aS'in contrast the social services working with my dad were very nice and helpful and worked with me'
p2559
aS'i have nothing compared to them why dont they just go away and leave me alone  they have done nothing to help me'
p2560
aS'confirmed today they wish to take me to court with all their powers'
p2561
aS'who do you want to be the nearest relative mum or dad why ask neither of us are nr that means they are planning something'
p2562
aS'at the care home she was excessively drugged and quite rightly i complained along with her being put in a position of '
p2563
aS'social services are taking me to court as they want to take elizabeth away from home and put her in a care home'
p2564
aS'your blog is brilliant by the way and i can verify everything you say'
p2565
aS'it was a pleasure to meet you at the institute of psychiatry where i confronted dr maccabe'
p2566
aS'everyone is welcome to come and check if you do not believe me'
p2567
aS'the therapeutic dose should be 100mg'
p2568
aS'they have been excessively drugging her and she expressed a wish to come home and has told many people of her wish'
p2569
aS'anyway it is irrelevant now as she is at home  she is ref to a care home run by northampton social services'
p2570
aS'you might have been on a good ward of cambian however i do not have a good experience paul'
p2571
aS'anyone coming off drugs is likely to feel ill but elizabeth is fine'
p2572
aS'i have been sitting outside in the garden with elizabeth and the cat and have been cooking'
p2573
aS'sorry i may have misread you i know someone on 800mg a day and 600 of lithium he can hardly move it is a disgrace and abuse'
p2574
aS'sorry paul but this is absolute rubbish and i have been getting top level advice from more than 1 professor'
p2575
aS'is no such thing as treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia and i want the world to know this'
p2576
aS'i know they will be taking me to court and doing everything in their powers to discredit me as a mother and person'
p2577
aS'the food was good but they tried to sever family contact  i am not saying every branch is the same'
p2578
aS'i am in touch with more than one professor looking at poor or non metabolism right now'
p2579
aS'however elizabeth is treaent resistant and cannot metabolise the drugs'
p2580
aS'if the dose works for u i am pleased paul'
p2581
aS'i respect u paul and what u r going through elizabeth is on a low dosage now and doing well'
p2582
aS'i have sought doctors opinions and higher than that paul i know i am just a mother and that means nothing'
p2583
aS'wow  that is a lot of people but elizabeth is much wanted at home in accordance with her wishes amp has told the family'
p2584
aS'i find it quite relaxing writing on here paul and elizabeth is also fond of writing too and has written her own comments'
p2585
aS'i am more relaxed than ever paul and tomorrow myself and elizabeth will be going out somewhere nice'
p2586
aS'there is no place like home paul'
p2587
aS'chill out out for a bitbecause you could never beat the social services or doctors opinions cambian a\xe2\x80\xa6'
p2588
aS'at home my daughter has her pet cat and is very content she is on less drugs and doing well'
p2589
aS'youd make a good promoter for cambian but my daughter is not there any more so we are not talking about cambian any more'
p2590
aS'she is not on a section or a cto either ok and i have taken professional advice'
p2591
aS'thank you paul for your kind advice i am sure they do have more resources and she is not at cambian by the way'
p2592
aS'the care home is drugging my daughter excessively and she has been fine with me'
p2593
aS'well i thank you so much  i speak the truth at the end of the day and certain professionals do not like it'
p2594
aS'well i am not scared into silence at alli would give my life for my daughter so why should i be scared of social services'
p2595
aS'thank you so much and to everyone who believes me to those who dont you are welcome to meet me in person'
p2596
aS'if it is the last thing on earth i ever do i shall make sure everyone knows who they are'
p2597
aS'coercion bullying and abuse'
p2598
aS'how come the local mp is not involving himself with council issues'
p2599
aS'i am not intimidated in the slightest bit by s services because somehow i have the strength and character to deal with it'
p2600
aS'i have enough evidence of what has been going on they may be above the law but they are not above god'
p2601
aS'they do not care about taxpayers money she is treatment resistant for a start  the drugs do not even work'
p2602
aS'they have been in favour of drugging my daughter and i know she cannot just come off these drugs it is all about control and money'
p2603
aS'social services are behind this and are wasting public money they are not working with the family and have never done so'
p2604
aS'all elizabeths possessions are at the care home and my main issue was the drugs now they have said to choose between mum and dad'
p2605
aS'she should be allowed a bit of time before social services wade in with their assessments destroying family completely and forever'
p2606
aS'capacity can be manipulated by the use of drugs or in this case deprival when i went out of my way to get it for her'
p2607
aS'it is a bit like the justina case but in the uk and concerning an adult and they play on capacity and destroy families'
p2608
aS'excessive drugging and a consultant psychiatrist who does not return one single call you make \xc2\xa3200 worth of things missing'
p2609
aS'if i was such a bad unfit mother then i would not have paid \xc2\xa31000 on private health checks'
p2610
aS'i would like to move houseeven country because nothing is fair in the uk  too much power is given to these people'
p2611
aS'i have arranged for elizabeth to have food delivered and company and i do not wish to speak to them again other than through advocates'
p2612
aS'it was hard to talk to the manager of social services today but i accused them of destroying my family and my happiness'
p2613
aS'i will not be around to control elizabeths life as i work full time but have some very good friends and would pay them to help'
p2614
aS'elizabeth is not on a section or a cto and social services would be saving money by her being at home'
p2615
aS'i have written to every councillor and had not one phone call anything they cannot forced her surely without putting her back on section'
p2616
aS'it is not only a breach of medical ethics but a breach of human rights to do this it is wrong that agreement has to come from s servs 1st'
p2617
aS'art 3 of the hra is about nondeprival of the drugs and social services have delayed an assessment and no one agreed to give the drug'
p2618
aS'in three days elizabeth has been well without the drugs  she has not suffered a relapse  no doubt i would have been slated otherwise'
p2619
aS'elizabeth signed an advanced declaration before going into the bethlem and was adamant she did not want the clozapine i agree with her'
p2620
aS'i believe in the new diagnosis and the treatment recommended in the report is intensive trauma therapy not clozapine'
p2621
aS'so she has been deprived of a report with a different diagnosis and the team are sticking together on this and ignoring a doctors advice'
p2622
aS'it would not be a fair assessment to be carried out now until the drugs are built up a bit and they want to do it now'
p2623
aS'elizabeth does not want to speak to anyone right now and is tired i respect that'
p2624
aS'if i send her back then she will be spoken to by staff and they can brainwash someone by the use of these drugs'
p2625
aS'lunch time meds are lorzepam which she has not needed since she has been at home she has not needed to smoke either since being home'
p2626
aS'one drug is a beta blocker  another is senna which i have ordered just in case'
p2627
aS'i would like to see her on 100mg of clozapine and not 350mg plus all the other drugs being given'
p2628
aS'i was shocked at the level and increase of drugs she has had at the care home  they can do what they like behind your back'
p2629
aS'elizabeth is on clozapine and i have taken her to harley street in a taxi and tried to get decent care there'
p2630
aS'elizabeth is fine and i have today been accused by the manager of social servs of depriving elizabeth of drugs'
p2631
aS'now they are using their legal teams against me in a secret court that should be made open to everyone'
p2632
aS'when elizabeth said i dont want to go back because they are asking me to choose between you and my dad i support her'
p2633
aS'she is 27 and in bed at 6 pm  i am not impressed with a care home owned by social services northampton who push excessive drugs'
p2634
aS'it is not unreasonable to ask that a review of elizabeths medication be given that she be on the lower dosage'
p2635
aS'social workers ar enot doctors to decide on what drug elizabeth should have  i dont think the drugs are doing me any good mum'
p2636
aS'court papers arriving at my desk at work phone call after phone call from legal teams pushing of clozapine by swrkr'
p2637
aS'this has been done several times before and i have proof'
p2638
aS'it is wrong to get a nurse to ask who do you want to be the next of kin'
p2639
aS'the reason they dont like me is because i care about the way she has been treated by them all  it is wrong to coerce'
p2640
aS'elizabeth has a diagnosis called ptsd by an experienced psychiatrist of many years social services are dismissive of this report'
p2641
aS'elizabeth is safe and well and is of no risk to herself and others but is weak at the moment she is only on a low dosage of drugs'
p2642
aS'social services have appointed their solicitors to force this to happen and yet again their legal teams are involved at public expense'
p2643
aS'elizabeth has been declined of drugs for three days now social services have been trying to force her back to the chome'
p2644
aS'social services wanted to come round to do an assessment however i have refused because it is not fair at the moment'
p2645
aS'elizabeth is in the garden in the sunshine on the new reclining chairs i have bought today to everyone elizabeth is well'
p2646
aS'only a headache so far'
p2647
aS'ive seen withdrawal from aripraprazole and that seemed to be going well up to a point what a pity'
p2648
aS'she needs to be on a small amount of this drug but not as much as before no problems whatsoever so far'
p2649
aS'ok so far but they have put her on a small amount and i want it kept like that'
p2650
aS'i do not have any time to go to any groups but i will have a look at this later'
p2651
aS'a 5ht receptor is rispiredon'
p2652
aS'under art 3 hra a patient has a right not to be refused treatment surely can any legal experts confirm this'
p2653
aS'i have seen withdrawal and am not afraid this is not your average drug though and they have a duty of care'
p2654
aS'elkizabeth is fine  we are waiting for the home treatment team to arrive with the chemical clozapine'
p2655
aS'a cat is more therapeutic than lorazepam and she has not needed anything  she says she is happy to be home'
p2656
aS'elizabeth is stable despite being deprived drugs for three days now clozapine the only thing is she is tired'
p2657
aS'if i say i want it stopped they will definitely have grounds to displace me i want the minimal of drugs not the maximum'
p2658
aS'i hope they turn up otherwise i will be down at the council offices just drop the drugs through the letter box  that will do'
p2659
aS'a mother may be ripped apart by these professionals who know nothing about the home and family'
p2660
aS'a nearest relative may wish to see a fairer system and because they speak out they get bullied'
p2661
aS'a nearest relative may well go along with the drugging but wants it at the minimal whereas it is in fact at the maximum'
p2662
aS'it is a waste of money going on when constantly social workers try to take court action against nearest relatives'
p2663
aS'stigma can only be challenged by openness and honesty and open diaglogue inclusion of families'
p2664
aS'well i have noticed however the only good thing was the food according to elizabeth not when coercion is going on'
p2665
aS'lorraine she was on far too much drugs  i complained when i saw how much she was on350 mg is too high a dosage for clozapine'
p2666
aS'it is because elizabeth was sent to cambian and i had to fight to get her off a section 3'
p2667
aS'where are the crisis team we are at home'
p2668
aS'well elizabeth is like me  strong she is showing no signs of withdrawal whatsoever after this unsatisfactory length of time'
p2669
aS'i have become very knowledgeable lately and have a lot of reading to do  so many new wonderful books and courses too'
p2670
aS'i am having enough trouble with getting the chemicals and avoiding my daughter after 3 days of trying really hard'
p2671
aS'not necessarily'
p2672
aS'elizabeth is home lorraine and i hope to listen to your most interesting broadcast elizabeth enjoyed talking to you'
p2673
aS'proper testing and assessments are needed for mh patients and the home treatment team are late'
p2674
aS'this knowledge is not used to the full capacity ie patients are ignored if they have serious side effects'
p2675
aS'there is the knowledge to be reduced safely by professionals who know exactly how this should be done'
p2676
aS'it is possible to switch from clozapine to risperidone at least this chemical is more widely available'
p2677
aS'im still not happy even if they do turn up noone should be forced to take these chemicals'
p2678
aS'drs were held back because of social services having to do an assessment however someone shd not be left without drugs for 3 days or more'
p2679
aS'a new system needs to be made whereby doctors make the decisions of assessments to speed matter up'
p2680
aS'anyway if the home treatment team does not turn up today i will bring elizabeth to the council myself and they can visit there'
p2681
aS'clozapine is not mentioned in nice guidelines for ptsd this is the new diagnosis'
p2682
aS'this could have been given instead i am so very lucky to have such good advice'
p2683
aS'the home treatment team will bring with them the chemicals needed but i have been told risperidone is a better drug'
p2684
aS'i am waiting for the home treatment team to call at my home hooray'
p2685
aS'elizabeth is a very strong and is ok apart from feeling tired not showing signs of withdrawal  am told risperidon is an alt'
p2686
aS'im in touch with experts on clozapine amp i will get some advice a report stating ptsd has been complete ignored by the team'
p2687
aS'my daughter is sitting in the computer room now and thinks my blog is great by the way occasionally she writes on it herself'
p2688
aS'i feel ok but i am feeling worn out'
p2689
aS'im elizabeth writing  i am having a good time at home i want to be at home but i really do need the meds'
p2690
aS'i will be lodging complaints personally to individuals if nothing tomorrow'
p2691
aS'they were questioning her  doctor and social worker and she did not want to answer questions and it is not fair'
p2692
aS'i feel like they want her to get unwell so that they can slap on yet another section'
p2693
aS'apparently waiting for the doctor to pass paperwork over to the home treatment department and they have not received it'

p2723
aS'i am sorry but there have been many occasions i have begged for help from the local mp'
p2724

p2370
aS'lack of follow thruthat wld mean do have ambition but lack initiation andor motivation to enact that ambition abichat'
p2371
aS'mmm yes ambition can be used as an impossible yardstick amp way to blame someone unfairly for failing to heal fast enuf abichat'

p2375
aS'or ambitious to start a new career or simply to be able to meet an old friend for coffee 1xweek abichat'

aS'when i used mine it actually worked pretty well its pretty easy to get free spikes when predicting an electric type move'
p2761
aS'too much'
p2762
aS'well i think so i play mine with uturn spikes dark pulse scald i dont like using greninja much though since i see it'
p2763
aS'wondertrade battles are fun as hell'
p2764
aS'im quite good i think im not gonna lie 3 but i rarely mind a battle im nearly always up for it when im home'
p2765
aS'there are definetly people who play pok\xc3\xa9mon better than me but instead of getting mad at them for being better you should learn from them'

aS'what nature and ability because there are some ways to play it 3'
p2772
aS'no problem i can also tell you about ivs and team building but i guess evs are a bit more important'
p2773
aS'ivs are a little more complicated imo'
p2774
aS'and this is also good'
p2775
aS'i see eviv isnt so difficult especially evs are easy now this is quite a good tutorial for the fastest methode'
p2776
aS'and people really dont expect a choice scarfed salamence they all expect one with dd'
p2777
aS'i just remember times when you saw salamence quite often now you only see dragonite i love salamence though'
p2778
aS'back in gen 4 this wouldnt have happened that often'
p2779
aS'its kinda weird that you can catch people off guard with salamence'
p2780
aS'im sad people have forgotten how powerful salamence is fuck dragonite'
p2781
aS'choice scarfed salamence putting in work'
p2782
aS'i love the gen 6 meta game it has so many possibilites but only a few people really use other stuff than greninja talonflame etc'
p2783
aS'i really got back into pokemon due to x and y i love the meta game'
p2784
aS'well i got to a grammar school so i have lots of different subjects like 14'
p2785
aS'hell yeah i took out a mega aerodactyl with my choice scarfed slamence'

p2791
aS'im doing pretty well 3'
p2792
aS'yeah even a modest greninja with hydro pump does only 99 damage at max'
p2793
aS'im pretty sure charizard x can do that'
p2794
aS'hi how are things'
p2795
aS'but if you ever decide to run a charizard x with dragon dance it will rip any greninja to pieces'
p2796
aS'yes charizard doesnt get faster after mega evolution'
p2797
aS'well thats logical greninja can have 191 speed on level 50 charizard can only have 167'
p2798
aS'even after one dragon dance'
p2799
aS'i actually calculated how much speed investment i need to outspeed greninja so i also have a little bulk on the ferraligatr'
p2800
aS'after one dragon dance my ferraligatr is faster than greninja by one point'
p2801
aS'wow a genesect which is slower than my not max speed invested ferraligatr'
